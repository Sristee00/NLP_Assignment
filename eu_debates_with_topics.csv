Victor Negrescu,S&D,"in writing. – The future MFF has to offer Europe a strong perspective for its recovery but also important commitments in terms of the type of economy and society we want to build for the future. The upcoming changes presumed to happen have been accelerated by the current COVID—19 crisis, and we need more than ever to try to make Europe a leading force of what will be the next technological revolutions. In this regard, we need an ambitious European budget and we need it now. We need the Member States to allocate more in order to do more things together in everyone’s interest. We need also fresh and fair own resources at EU level that protect our standards but also generate new funds for our objectives. Allocating EUR 2 trillion for the recovery plan can be a strong starting point. We need to allocate grants to those that most need it in order to create jobs and ensure the protection of our social standards. But what we have to make sure is that all these opportunities will be available to all Member States. The next budget can be a blueprint for the future we want to build. The new MFF must change Europe, or the EU may no more survive it.","in writing. – The future MFF has to offer Europe a strong perspective for its recovery but also important commitments in terms of the type of economy and society we want to build for the future.

Ildikó Gáll-Pelcz ,PPE,"Elnök Asszony, Biztos Úr, Miniszterelnök Úr! Gratulálok Önnek az ambiciózus tervéhez, ahhoz a négy ponthoz, amit ismertetett. És gratulálok az észtek első elnökségének is, kívánom, hogy ez a program úgy, ahogyan tervezte, valósuljon meg. Bár említette, hogy nem szeretne kifejezetten a brexitre koncentrálni, azért nyilván Ön is elismeri, hogy a brexit megkerülhetetlen tényező lesz az Önök elnökségében. Sőt, azt mondom, hogy minekután a tárgyalások most kezdődnek meg, nagyon fontos, hogy milyen kiindulási pontokat fogunk meghatározni. Ön számára is, az Ön országa számára is, minden európai ország számára fontos, hogy a Nagy-Britanniában dolgozó európai uniós állampolgárok milyen helyzetben maradnak. Sőt, azt is mondhatom, hogy a nagy-britanniai állampolgárok milyen helyzetben maradnak az Európai Unióban. Egy közös, jó megállapodást kell hozni. Említette a digitális gazdaságot, amit én nagyon fontos dolognak tartok, a belső piac kiteljesedésének egyik útjának tekintem. 430 milliárd euróról van szó, ha sikerül ezt a programot megvalósítani. Mégis szeretném felhívni az Ön figyelmét egy másik témára, amely szoros kapcsolatba van ezzel – ez a körforgásos gazdaság. Van egy jelentésem, ami egy kiváló jelentés a termésnövelő termékekről, aminek a trilógusa most fog megkezdődni. Ez hozzájárulhat ahhoz, hogy ez a körforgásos gazdaság kialakulhasson és kiteljesedhessen. Kívánok Önnek jó elnöklést ehhez!","Elnök Asszony, Biztos Úr, Miniszterelnök Úr!

José Manuel Fernandes ,PPE," The joint motion for a resolution in question, tabled pursuant to Rule 110(2) and (4) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, replacing the motions by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, focuses on the situation in Belarus following the legislative elections that took place on 23 September. After the elections were held, many criticised them as fraudulent, among them the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, and the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, Thorbjørn Jagland. In fact, several instances of violations were confirmed by independent international observers and there was a lack of transparency in the counting of the votes, which makes it possible to assert that the election results do not reflect the will of the Belarusian people. I voted in favour of this joint motion for a resolution because I believe that the international community must draw Belarus’s attention to its obligation to respect democratic values, such as the primacy of the rule of law and human rights, and to abolish the death penalty immediately.","The joint motion for a resolution in question, tabled pursuant to Rule 110 and of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, replacing the motions by the Group of the European People’s Party , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, focuses on the situation in Belarus following the legislative elections that took place on 23 September.

Josep Borrell Fontelles,N/A," Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, this is the seventh debate on Nicaragua since the end of 2019. It shows the importance that the European Parliament gives to the situation in Nicaragua. And rightly so. Allow me to thank you for this continued and strong interest and to reiterate that I fully share your concerns regarding the continuously deteriorating human rights situation in this country. You know that the European Union position has been clear and consistent in its strong condemnation of the systematic repression that the people of Nicaragua is suffering. We have repeatedly been calling for the liberation of all political prisoners with the return to the rule of law, return of international human rights organisations in the country and for the dialogue between the regime and the opposition. This is a long story. We first introduced sanctions in October 2019. It was still not there. It was at that time Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Spain paying the same attention to the Nicaragua situation that you were doing here in Brussels and Strasbourg. In October 2019, the Council repeatedly expressed its concerns about the political and social situation in the country. Restrictive measures now apply to a total of 21 persons and three entities. And, as you know, these measures are targeted and designed not to harm the Nicaraguan population, but those responsible of the dire situation the people in Nicaragua is suffering. I would like to underline also our continued commitment to the Nicaraguan people and to defend democracy and human rights, which is as important as ever, following the release and deportation of 222 political prisoners early this year that were deprived of their nationality. Indeed, we hoped that the release of political prisoners would mark the beginning of a dialogue with the regime and an end to Nicaragua’s authoritarian spiral. Regrettably, shortly after such release, the regime revoked all 222 deportees of their Nicaraguan citizenship. It also further stripped 94 other Nicaraguans of their nationality and confiscated their property. All for opposing the Ortega-Murillo regime. We can no longer call it the Ortega regime, it is more and more the Ortega-Murillo regime, or maybe Murillo alone. That is why it’s important to continue supporting the people of Nicaragua, including through our development cooperation. The wider population and particularly vulnerable groups, such as women, children, youth and indigenous people, should not suffer twice for the actions of the repressive and undemocratic regime. I want to use this opportunity to reassure you that the European Union, since the beginning of the socio-political crisis in April 2018, does not provide support to the Nicaraguan authorities, nor does it channel funds directly through the Government. While the space of the civil society has shrunk drastically, our commitment to deliver cooperation activities and support those in need remains intact, because we don’t want to punish Nicaraguan people twice. Rest assured, the European Union institutions and its Member States will continue to monitor the socio-political economic situation in the country, through our delegation in Managua in particular. And we will also continue to support the legitimate demands of the Nicaraguan people for their human rights and for the return of democracy. Thank you for putting Nicaragua’s case again in the agenda of the European Parliament. I am looking forward to the debate. I hope that this will be heard on the other side of the Atlantic.","Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, this is the seventh debate on Nicaragua since the end of 2019.

Siegfried Mureşan ,PPE,"Mr President, you are being very generous with our speaking time this morning. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I also welcome the decision of the Commission on the Corporate Tax package, which was of course long overdue. In this regard I also welcome the relaunch of the common consolidated corporate tax base, which was introduced in 2011, but too little has been done to enforce it across Member States. More progress has to be made here, and much faster. Until now, big multinationals had considerable tax benefits to the disadvantage of SMEs, as has already been said. The Commission has a strong role to play in paving the way for a level playing field between SMEs and big multinationals. This is a crucial factor for supporting a better business environment for every company active in the single market, be it small or large. SMEs are a major job creator in Europe, therefore making corporate taxation fairer for all companies also safeguards employment here in Europe. Moreover, entrepreneurship and start—up creation are essential for innovation and the creation of the jobs of the future. Only then will a competitive advantage of European companies in the long term be ensured. The establishment of cross-border business is facilitated by making conditions equal for all companies and by improving coordination across Europe. Europe can catch up considerably in the areas just mentioned. So far, cross border e-commerce in Europe can still be expanded and facilitated. Only then will we create the foundations for a truly integrated single market in the coming years.","Mr President, you are being very generous with our speaking time this morning.

Mick Wallace,GUE/NGL," – The UN Charter is the foundational treaty of the United Nations, since 1945. When Russia invaded Ukraine, they breached the rules of the UN Charter. It was illegal. Sadly, it has been breached far too often.  I’ve just read this excellent book by Vijay Prashad and Noam Chomsky: The Withdrawal. It highlights how the UN Charter has been abused. Here are a few quotes from the book: ‘The war in Afghanistan was unprovoked, it was an illegitimate aggression, and it was a severe atrocity.’; ‘40% of civilians killed by airstrikes were children.’; ‘The US had no basis whatsoever for invading Afghanistan.’  The UN Charter was ignored.  The US assassination campaign by drones is the worst territorial campaign in the world so far. It kills people that the US believes pose a threat to the US or to its interests.  The UN Charter is ignored.  In 1991, the US refused to accept Saddam’s surrender and bombed everywhere they could. When asked why, President Bush said, ‘We’ve shown that what we say goes’.  The UN Charter was ignored.  It’s long past time that all countries should respect the UN Charter, and the UN or the EU should have nothing to do with those that don’t.

I’ve just read this excellent book by Vijay Prashad and Noam Chomsky: The Withdrawal. It highlights how the UN Charter has been abused.

Gilles Lebreton,ID," – Madame la Présidente, chers collègues, le peuple tunisien a décidé en 2011, par une révolution que le monde entier a admirée, d’instaurer un régime démocratique. L’Union européenne l’a soutenu dans ce choix. Dix ans après, les promesses de la révolution n’ont, hélas, pas été tenues. La situation économique et sociale de la Tunisie s’est fortement dégradée et d’énormes manifestations ont dénoncé une corruption endémique. Je comprends que, face à ce chaos, le président Saïed ait décidé de réagir. Élu avec plus de 72 % des voix, il dispose de la légitimité démocratique pour le faire. Vu d’Europe, les moyens qu’il a employés sont certes surprenants: prise des pleins pouvoirs le 25 juillet, suspension de la Constitution le 22 septembre. Mais je veux croire que l’objectif du président Saïed est, comme il le dit, d’instaurer le plus vite possible une démocratie débarrassée de la corruption. Et je ne doute pas qu’un agenda politique véritablement démocratique sera dévoilé prochainement avec l’annonce de l’élaboration d’une nouvelle Constitution, puis l’organisation d’élections.

There is much more today than unfortunate communication. The 3.5% surplus target is unrealistic for a longer period: that is one of the reasons that the IMF has consistently argued that, without debt relief, the Greek economy will be in the woods for many years – even decades to come.  Moreover, I find the contingency measures on the table disturbing and dangerous. It entails the importation of a pro-cyclical policy of engineering a downturn.  So let’s be honest; let’s not play games. What Greece needs is debt relief in combination with reforms and investments. Only then will Greece become independent and be able to build a better future for itself.

Within the present MFF, regarding own resources based on VAT, a 0.30 % uniform rate can be applied to the harmonised basis of assessment for transactions for VAT in each Member State. The taxed basis of the VAT is frozen at 50 % of the gross national income in every country to prevent less wealthy Member States from paying disproportionate sums, since VAT represents a larger percentage of the internal revenue in countries with reduced income.

Naša legislatíva musí byť nástrojom, ktorý chráni záujmy detí a zabezpečuje ich práva, a preto je dôležité, aby všetky členské štáty Európskej únie ratifikovali a uplatňovali dohovory Medzinárodnej organizácie práce úplne a účinne. Je potrebné, aby sme pracovali s partnermi na celom svete na odstránení tohto nehumánneho javu. Naším cieľom musí byť to, aby boli deti chránené pred všetkými formami vykorisťovania, a zabezpečiť im primerané vzdelanie, zdravotnú starostlivosť a prístup k základným právam.

João Ferreira ,GUE/NGL," This is another part of the package of six legislative texts on so-called economic governance, which aims to strengthen surveillance of budgetary positions, and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies. This regulation lays down the rules regulating the content, presentation, examination and monitoring of stability programmes and convergence programmes, as part of the multilateral surveillance that the Commission and Council want to carry out at an early stage; the argument being to prevent budget deficits and excessive debt, and to promote the surveillance and coordination of economic policy. This is an unacceptable draining away of competences from the political structures that are close to, and controlled by, the public. They always argue that the objective is growth and employment, but, as they have forgotten policies of solidarity, and of economic and social cohesion, committing only to monetarist and neoliberal policies in the interests of guaranteeing greater profits for large companies and financial institutions, what we will have is more social inequality, more unemployment and more poverty, as the cases of Greece, Ireland and Portugal have already shown. With these texts we will therefore witness a deterioration of the economic, social and political situation, which will inevitably cause further social tension and more conflicts, with unforeseeable consequences.","This is another part of the package of six legislative texts on so-called economic governance, which aims to strengthen surveillance of budgetary positions, and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies.

Oreste Rossi ,ID," I am strongly opposed to the report in question. The motto ‘united in diversity’ allows for everyone to be master in his own backyard and the European Union cannot and must not force us to accept unwelcome guests. Denying ourselves the right to return illegal migrants to their countries of origin goes against every rule of good sense. If legality is not respected, we risk an invasion of millions of desperate people in flight. People who suffer need to be helped, but in their own countries, by preventing the trafficking of human beings. I strongly reject accusations of European racism and xenophobia, because I am tired of watching illegal Tunisian migrants going on strike because they are not being given money to buy cigarettes, refusing to eat food containing tuna because it smells of fish, and, once in Italy, demanding housing and work (for free, of course), when we have our own indigenous unemployed and poor people. Compliments to the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, are surely wasted since in reality she has had no idea how to handle the current crisis in the Maghreb. The icing on the cake, meanwhile, is having to consider lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and transgender people as persecuted or having few rights and therefore worthy of particular attention.","I am strongly opposed to the report in question.

It has cost some kind of blood, sweat and tears but, finally, we are going to vote for this tomorrow, and I am very proud of all of us. We have got things done. It’s also a balanced agreement so my party is also going to vote for this. It’s a good way to enable legal migration and to also show that the EU can be attractive for highly—qualified people who want to work here. Our EU is in danger of missing the boat when it comes to attracting these highly talented and educated people, so we need to be innovative and this European Blue Card can do that. This reform can do that. I am pleased that the Blue Card will provide faster, easier and more inclusive access for these highly qualified people that, otherwise, the US, Canada and the UK would take away from us. In addition, Member States will still be able to retain their national systems for labour migration, and this is important because it will still allow each Member State to take into account the reality of their own labour market. They will also use mechanisms that ensure that highly skilled non—EU workers are admitted only after the national database has been exhausted. The EU could not stay behind. The revision was very much needed and, of course, we have to thank our Commissioner for speeding up the process. It has been a huge teamwork. At the beginning of a long road, we never know where we are going to end, but we can say that, when we work together and listen to each other, we can achieve bigger things.

He wants even greater integration of economic and fiscal policy, and economic governance of the Member States by the EU. He wants to guarantee the security of the Balkans and Poland against any military threat from Russia. If the British people want to remain in the EU then this is what is in store for them: never ending uncontrolled and unlimited immigration from Africa, the Middle East and beyond; Britain's eventual entry into the European Single Currency; and the creation of a European Army, which will absorb the British armed forces.

There is no doubt that the damage to the Fukushima nuclear power plant is a disaster, but the final death toll will not be counted in thousands or hundreds, and perhaps not even in tens.

De mochila às costas, cheia, certamente, de incertezas, senti que conquistei Madrid como se fosse a minha pequena aldeia.  Foram 10 eternos e maravilhosos meses onde me fiz aprendiz de cientista e onde me fiz, já aí, europeu pleno. Mas, antes de rumar à Europa, eu já tinha vindo a sentir a Europa de uma forma muito especial, com todos os alunos Erasmus que visitavam a minha universidade e aí permaneciam um semestre ou um ano inteiro. Foram estes “Erasmus” que me antecederam que primeiro me ensinaram o que era ser verdadeiramente europeu. Queria, dizer-vos, queria dizer-te, Europa, que estás certa quando tens ambição de fazer do Erasmus um parceiro ao longo da vida para todos os teus cidadãos. Terás, certamente, Europa, uma existência mais ampliada porque serás certamente mais Europa, porque nós, os que tivemos a experiência e todos os europeus, seremos mais cidadãos.

Mudei-me depois para uma das mais antigas universidades portuguesas e depois tive a oportunidade de rumar à Europa. De mochila às costas, cheia, certamente, de incertezas, senti que conquistei Madrid como se fosse a minha pequena aldeia. Foram 10 eternos e maravilhosos meses onde me fiz aprendiz de cientista e onde me fiz, já aí, europeu pleno. Mas, antes de rumar à Europa, eu já tinha vindo a sentir a Europa de uma forma muito especial, com todos os alunos Erasmus que visitavam a minha universidade e aí permaneciam um semestre ou um ano inteiro. Foram estes “Erasmus” que me antecederam que primeiro me ensinaram o que era ser verdadeiramente europeu. Queria, dizer-vos, queria dizer-te, Europa, que estás certa quando tens ambição de fazer do Erasmus um parceiro ao longo da vida para todos os teus cidadãos. Terás, certamente, Europa, uma existência mais ampliada porque serás certamente mais Europa, porque nós, os que tivemos a experiência e todos os europeus, seremos mais cidadãos. Quem vos fala é um embaixador ativo do programa Erasmus e da Europa. Relativamente aos meses que por lá passei, pouco direi, porque todos nós sabemos que o acontece no Erasmus fica no Erasmus. Muito obrigado, Europa. Muito obrigado, Erasmus.","Senhor Presidente, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, Senhoras e Senhores Comissários, Senhora Ministra, caros “Erasmus”, também aqui presentes, caros concidadãos europeus, bom dia a todos. Feliz coincidência esta entre os recentes 30 anos de Portugal na União Europeia e os 30 anos de Erasmus em Portugal e na Europa.

Alessandro Panza,ID," – Signora Presidente, signor Alto rappresentante, onorevoli colleghi, condividiamo le preoccupazioni per quanto sta accadendo tra Ucraina e Russia e serve il massimo impegno di tutti per scongiurare qualsiasi tipo di escalation che possa sfociare in un conflitto armato, minaccia che per ora sembra solo tale ma che, se disgraziatamente dovesse concretizzarsi, porterebbe a conseguenze drammatiche per un'Europa già duramente provata dalla pandemia. Ampliando però un po' il campo visivo sullo scacchiere internazionale non possiamo fingere che non ci sia un convitato di pietra in tutta questa situazione, che nessuno ha citato. Desta infatti particolare preoccupazione la notizia secondo cui il Presidente della Turchia Erdoğan si sia proposto come mediatore nella disputa tra Ucraina e Russia. Caro Alto rappresentante, qual è la posizione dell'Europa su questo tema? Ma soprattutto, quando usciremo da questa situazione di imbarazzo? Dico imbarazzo perché siamo in una situazione in cui sembra si continui a ignorare i fatti. Vogliamo continuare a ignorare che la Turchia acquisti sistemi antimissilistici dalla Russia pur essendo membro della NATO? Vogliamo continuare a ignorare il fatto che la Turchia vende droni all'Ucraina?  Vogliamo continuare a fingere che il comportamento della Turchia non abbia come scopo quello di impedire un conflitto, ma solo quello di consolidare la propria egemonia geopolitica su tutto il confine orientale e meridionale dell'Europa, partendo proprio dall'Ucraina e arrivando fino alla Libia? Vogliamo continuare a sottostare al ricatto dei migranti portato avanti dal regime turco, che poi abbiamo visto trovare anche degli emulatori come accaduto sul confine polacco-bielorusso solo poche settimane fa? Solo perché l'Europa non è in grado di fare una seria politica di frontiera lasciandola solo agli Stati membri. Se la politica estera europea vuole finalmente battere un colpo e smettere di essere in balia degli eventi, oltre ad annunciare le solite sanzioni, inizi a prendere delle decisioni serie e smetta di finanziare il dittatore turco.  Smettiamo di raccontarci la favola che i miliardi di euro che l'Europa dà alla Turchia servono per le minoranze e per favorire un processo di democratizzazione, mentre sappiamo benissimo che sono solo soldi dei cittadini europei che vengono usati da Erdoğan per consolidare il proprio potere geopolitico.","– Signora Presidente, signor Alto rappresentante, onorevoli colleghi, condividiamo le preoccupazioni per quanto sta accadendo tra Ucraina e Russia e serve il massimo impegno di tutti per scongiurare qualsiasi tipo di escalation che possa sfociare in un conflitto armato, minaccia che per ora sembra solo tale ma che, se disgraziatamente dovesse concretizzarsi, porterebbe a conseguenze drammatiche per un'Europa già duramente provata dalla pandemia.

Christian Ehler,PPE,"on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2020, the Commission proudly announced a new industrial policy to implement the European Green Deal as a growth strategy. Yet it took a loud bang from the US to wake up the von der Leyen Commission. Three years later, they finally woke up to the fact that simply placing Fit for 55 regulation is not enough. We need a business case for the European industry that the industrial transition will be a success. The EPP Group welcomes, therefore, the Green Deal Industrial plan, but the EPP Group really wants to make sure that the von der Leyen Commission hears this final warning shot loud and clear. So far, the Commission approach has to be too prescriptive, too ideological, and too much focused on regulating the demand side of the European market. Technology neutrality was an afterthought rather than a leading principle. What we need is a serious effort to create a regulatory framework that gives our industry certainty and freedom to innovate and invest. This requires simple, fast, predictable decisions on state aid and permitting, for example, and domestic sourcing of raw materials. Productivity is our industry’s competitive advantage, not even mentioned in the statement from the Commission. Our social and energy costs are among the highest in the world, but so is also the quality of our scientists and engineers. We need to address these high costs, but most importantly, we need to unleash the potential of our innovation—driven productivity growth. To ensure our competitiveness on the global market we also need an ambitious free trade agenda, and yes, we want to ratify the pending trade agreements. If the von der Leyen Commission realises what needs to happen, the European economy can thrive and provide quality jobs for our citizens also in the future. And only if our economy thrives, the European Green Deal can be a success.","on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2020, the Commission proudly announced a new industrial policy to implement the European Green Deal as a growth strategy.

Enrique Guerrero Salom,S&D," Mr President, Commissioner, in the sitting yesterday, we had an experience that is unusual in this House. There was intense, prolonged and widespread applause for the President of the Commission. It was intense because it was not in any way formal or conventional, prolonged because it lasted for a long time, and widespread because almost the whole House applauded the President of the Commission based on two considerations: firstly, his attitude of defending the general interests of the Union in the Council meeting last week in response to the defence of the individual interests of some or many Heads of State or Government. This attitude was acknowledged by the President of Parliament, Mr Schulz, and is appreciated by Parliament, which not in vain represents the vast majority: all Europeans. However, there was also applause for a common concern of the Commission and Parliament for the deterioration of the situation of the European Union, caused by the economic crisis, which is damaging the lives of Europeans and their conditions, and is creating poverty in the Union. It is a concern for the growth of euro-scepticism and of extremist options in various countries of the Union, and also a common concern regarding the deterioration of institutional relations within the Union. The Commission and Parliament are seeing part of our competences being taken away by growing intergovernmentalism and the lack of Community method in many of the important decisions that are being taken. There was therefore an awareness in Parliament that we needed to work together, in order to defend these interests of Europeans. I think that we also need to work in Parliament towards a joint resolution expressing a position that is broadly shared of making requirements of the Commission and also supporting the Commission when it does what Parliament asks of it. My group wants an ambitious Commission work programme that stimulates growth, employment and quality of life, that re-establishes confidence among Europeans, and that seeks greater economic governance, a good multiannual financial framework, the creation of a European amortisation fund, a route map for stability bonds, improved anti-fraud measures, the strengthening of the European semester, the development of bonds and the right level of payment appropriations for 2013. I would like to point out to the President that the majority of groups have decided to postpone voting until September, in order to allow more time to reach a joint resolution that finally speaks with one voice from Parliament on making requirements of and supporting the Commission.","Mr President, Commissioner, in the sitting yesterday, we had an experience that is unusual in this House.

Looking ahead to the Barcelona Summit in June, I think that it is very important for us to reaffirm Parliament’s commitment to the success of this project in an area which, as we are all aware, is located at the crossroads of three continents and which is obviously important to Europe in geostrategic and cultural terms. I am somewhat concerned by Mr Baudis’s scepticism regarding the possibility of this summit being postponed. I hope that it will not come to this and that we will use all the institutional resources available to us to ensure this summit goes ahead. This will mark not only an occasion for reflection, but also an institutional success because the Union for the Mediterranean needs to overcome political impasses and institutional difficulties in the process of implementing the six strategic projects which embody the institution’s very essence. The durability and credibility of the Union for the Mediterranean depend on its ability to operate. To do this, it not only needs adequate funding for implementing the projects and running the secretariat, but I also think that greater involvement is required from civil society and national and parliamentary groups, as well as from the EMPA to ensure the democratic legitimacy of the Union for the Mediterranean.","I wish to say that, nearly two years after the launch of the Union for the Mediterranean, it is time for us take stock of this new federating project and also reflect on its prospects for development.

This report, drafted by our fellow Member, Mr Moreira, tables a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on repealing certain obsolete Council acts: temporary acts that have exhausted their effects, content that has been taken up by successive acts or resulted from a subsequently repealed international agreement, interim instruments, measures linked to the accession of new Member States, etc. I therefore welcome this proposal, which aims to ‘clean up’ certain European laws that are out of step with reality and is in fulfilment of the interinstitutional agreement on better law making, which, in the name of transparency and the certainty of Union law, recommends their repeal, with a view to ‘more clarity and legal certainty for the Union’s citizens and institutions’.","Over the course of almost six decades of existence, the European Union’s name has changed: European Economic Community, European Community and European Union.

Clare Daly,GUE/NGL,"on behalf of The Left Group. – Mr President, while enjoying working with colleagues on the report, we have made no secret that we are resolutely opposed to the majority position of the committee and, obviously, this report is no different. Our minority report, which is attached, I think, makes the reasons why very clear. And it isn’t that we don’t think that foreign interference and disinformation are serious social harms deserving of special attention. We do, and they are. It isn’t that we don’t think that Russia and China do propaganda and disinformation. Of course they do. All powerful states do. It is because throughout the work of this committee, the focus has been selective. The report is silent on the most consequential sources of disinformation and interference in European democracy: that of large concentrations of capital, foreign and European, exercising massive influence over law-making and policy formation in the EU and Member States through private media ownership, corporate lobbying and political funding. The report makes no mention of the defence industry and how it has corrupted European policy, to drive up weapons-spending and escalation. An industry needs an enemy, and the report gives it one or two, and I think the section on elite capture shows this point very well. The report is very strong on condemning those who go to work in the Russian industry companies, and fair point, but our motion on having the similar condemnation of those who go and join American finance companies is voted down. So instead of tackling interference in democracy, the committee has actually had a one-track mind focusing on China and Russia to the exclusion of everything else. It poses a child’s version of political reality. The world is divided into democracies and authoritarian regimes: goodies and baddies. The baddies tell only lies, the goodies never utter an untrue word. And in the middle of all of this, the European Union is an innocent victim of all of this geopolitical aggression and propaganda, not a geopolitical actor itself with its own agenda. So, instead of fighting propaganda, the committee has actually become a platform for it. We had a litany of NATO-funded think-tanks all coming from the same hymn sheet to inform us. Is it any wonder that we’re left with the report the way it is, it is in their interest to spread this hysteria? And the consequence of this is insidious, it means mainstream political parties don’t have to take account of their own actions. They can blame the foreigners, the foreign interference, for that. So our concern all along has been that this poses a threat to fundamental freedoms and civil society in Europe. And it might point out that a number of the measures we’re voting for here are in direct contradiction with measures that we’ll be voting on later on to protect civil society in a LIBE Committee report, because it is calling for a ‘whole of society’ approach. Criticism of European mainstream politics has to be seen as disinformation debunked by state-funded fact-checking organisations. The correct version of reality, including EU foreign policy, has to be promoted by strategically state-funded strategic communication centres – George Orwell’s 1984 springs to mind. Social media companies have to be brought to heal and pressure to censor anybody who has a different view of the official version of the truth. Political parties and politicians sceptical to NATO and EU narratives have to be placed under suspicion of being proxies of foreign powers. But you know what? Avoiding conflict and de-escalation tensions means listening to your opponent, listening to their concerns, taking them seriously, however fraught the disagreement, and looking for compromises. But the function of this committee has been the opposite. It should make them be disinformation and condemn them as such. Strong democracies tolerate internal dissent but this actually is textbook McCarthyism designed to stigmatise dissent, incite the public against internal critics, eradicate common sense and make all opposition unacceptable. It is a deliberate impairment of our society’s ability to think of extra-critical importance in these times of horrendous war. I and we absolutely reject it utterly.","on behalf of The Left Group. – Mr President, while enjoying working with colleagues on the report, we have made no secret that we are resolutely opposed to the majority position of the committee and, obviously, this report is no different.

Secondly, I share the concerns and we are working towards a prudent and far-sighted buildings policy for security and for staff. The third point is that the EUR 1 500 increase was agreed and put into reserve by the Committee on Budgets.

Phil Hogan,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first of all, I want to thank the House for their contributions, but it is an opportunity as well to thank some people that have been involved in the EU—Vietnam negotiations. Can I thank Mr Lange, the Chair of the Committee on International Trade (INTA), Mr Bourgeois, the rapporteur, and all the shadows who have been involved in the scrutiny of this particular deal? To note that the four committee Chairs that are indirectly involved in this scrutiny have given their support for the deal. Can I thank former Commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, and the DG TRADE officials for their tremendous work over many years in relation to this deal? As many speakers have said, these are the first trade and investment agreements to be voted on by this Parliament. And I hope that they will receive your approval so that our companies, particularly our SMEs that have been mentioned by many of you, can start tapping into the potential and generate growth and employment. In such uncertain times for global trade, a positive vote of course will send a strong signal in relation to the EU’s commitment to an open and fair trade based on rules and values. I can assure you that we will monitor implementation very closely, because I agree with many of you that there are issues that have to be resolved and will constantly require us to ensure the Vietnam lives up to its commitments. I’m fully aware of these particular sentiments. But, in relation to some of the specifics that we mentioned, horse trade is usually associated with market access, and this has been a very good deal in terms of EU-Vietnamese reciprocity in so many products. Mr Juncker has mentioned issues in relation to food and can I confirm that the Free Trade Agreement liberalises all EU export offensive interests, like beef, pork, poultry, wines, spirits and beer, but it also has safeguards for some of our sensitive issues, like rice, sugar, sweetcorn and canned tuna. These safeguards are a new dimension in relation to our free trade agreements in recent years, which includes for the first time a free trade agreement that we are ratifying where safeguards are given in respect of tariff rate quotas (TRQs). We have also got recognition by Vietnam in this deal for the European Union to be treated as a single entity for sanitary and phytosanitary terms, which will reduce a lot of the non-tariff barriers that we have. Equally, our 169 geographical indications right around the European Union have been protected. On the trade and sustainable development (TSD) chapter, improving the implementation and enforcement of all our agreements is very important, and this is a key priority for the Commission. Vietnam is a good example of where they are making considerable efforts even before the deal has been implemented in relation to TSD matters, with important progress being made. So the pressure that you’ve applied is certainly bearing fruit. But we have also established an institutional structure through the domestic advisory groups, which will include all stakeholders, including NGOs, civil society, businesses and all the services that will have an input in relation to the implementation of this agreement. The implementation is very important. That’s why we’re establishing as well in the Commission a chief trade enforcement officer during the course of the next few months. The new labour code, which was adopted in November 2019, recognises the principle of freedom of association possibly to set up independent trade unions at enterprise level, as I mentioned earlier, which is outside the scope of the dominant Vietnam general confederation of labour. So Vietnam has started the implementation. It has a master plan that’s going to be implemented by January 2021 and one of the aspects is to check its consistency with all other legal documents, including the penal code and the criminal code. The ILO Conventions has said that six out of eight are implemented. We’re at the same stage as we were in terms of the implementation of this agreement with Japan. So I think this is good progress by Vietnam. Vietnam has started preparations to set up these independent civil society organisations, and last week they gave me an action plan and a timescale in relation to their implementation. I mentioned child labour. There has been a 40% reduction since 2012 and of course they are committed to a new action plan to eradicate poverty over the 2021—2025 period. Some Members have mentioned human rights, and rightly so. It does remain an area of concern in our relationship with Vietnam, but we must take into account where the country has come from and see clear evidence of progress in the last 25 years, notably in the socioeconomic domain. Human rights improvements are central to our engagement, and there’s a binding and enforceable link between the FTA, investment protection agreement (IPA) and the partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA) that allows for total or partial suspension of the agreement in case of systemic or severe breaches on human rights. We also have an annual human rights dialogue and there’s a meeting next week in Hanoi so these are all, I think, positives. There are divergences between us and I’m not saying anything otherwise, but we are convinced that the agreements provide an initial platform to engage with Vietnamese society and governments on these issues. This is the view of several Vietnamese NGOs who say that the implementation of this agreement would open more space for civil society. Now clearly Ms Daly and Mr Wallace have not heard those particular voices in relation to that part of the deal. The EU is of course also closely concerned about political prisoners and persons of concern. We have a list of persons of concern that we have been regularly raising in our exchanges at the highest level. And we are striving to make sure that the EU delegation are not only consistently ensuring that these people are released, but also attending trials, meeting family members and providing the best possible facilities for the families of these political prisoners. The FTA and the IPA will create another important and conducive environment to ensure that these issues are not put under the table, but are consistently high on the agenda. The lack of ratification of the agreement would leave the European Union with no instrument at all to support a reform agenda for Vietnam, and we will push Vietnam closer to other partners that do not necessarily share the same values if we don’t have this agreement. The institutional set up again, as I mentioned in the context of various fora to speak about these issues, is very important. Environment was mentioned: of course Vietnam is one of the countries that are most affected by climate change. So surely they are interested in implementing the Paris Agreement, which they have signed up to. And, under the trade and sustainable development chapter, this is explicitly mentioned. So their national determined contributions are going to ensure, like other partners around the world where we do deals, that are going to have to implement this in a legally binding way, as they have signed up to in relation to the Paris Agreement. So this is another win and another example of where we are providing the framework where we can implement, through this free trade agreement, the necessary leverage to ensure that these commitments are met. Vietnam has also concluded with the EU a forest law enforcement, governance and trade voluntary partnership agreement (FLEGT VPA), which has been enforced since 1 June 2019. And this particular partnership agreement aims to ensure that all timber products imported into the European Union from Vietnam are legal. This is very significant as Vietnam is a major processing hub, importing timber from over 80 countries, including from a number of high-risk countries in the region such as Cambodia. Under the VPA, Vietnam has to introduce mandatory due diligence obligations for its importers. Vietnam is currently working on the implementation of this particular scheme through the various licences that will have to ensure traceability. So our one major success in this field has been the open and constructive participation of all the relevant stakeholders in Vietnam during the negotiation phase. These are the issues that have come to the fore and we have got a response. We have to continue ultimately of course to reach our final destination and our objectives. Finally, on this issue in relation to concern about the investment court system, following the European Parliament’s demands, the investment protection agreement with Vietnam includes the most modern and reformed investment protection framework in any agreement with an investment court system for the resolution of investment disputes, replacing the traditional investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) arbitration mechanism, and this has been confirmed as the proper way to go by the European Court of Justice decision that was recently made. So all of the elements of the ISDS under CETA are included in the IPA with Vietnam, which is an additional stepping stone towards the establishment of a multilateral investment court. Finally, in conclusion, could I say that, by voting in favour of this free trade agreement, you are voting in favour of a deal that will give us the political and institutional influence and the proper structures to make improvements on issues like human rights, like labour rights, like climate change and like environment policies. By voting ‘no’ you are consigning our influence to resolutions and letters that may or may not be taken into account and will most probably be ignored. This agreement puts the EU and Vietnam together in a political structure and enforcement mechanisms that will deliver common objectives, in particular in the policy areas that have been mentioned in this House. I know that many of these issues have been of concern for many years. Now we have a structured way in which we can deal with these issues. So it is time to be positive, to acknowledge that the EU stands together with the people of Vietnam, and vote positively for this deal.","Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first of all, I want to thank the House for their contributions, but it is an opportunity as well to thank some people that have been involved in the EU—Vietnam negotiations.

Hannu Takkula,ALDE," Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you for the opportunity to speak for a moment on behalf of my group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, about this important report on the European Heritage Label. Listening to the debate today, sometimes my impressions recalled what a certain teacher once told me: anything that can be misunderstood will be misunderstood. By this I mean that some try to see this excellent project – whose purpose is to raise Europe’s profile and show that Europe’s strength lies in its diversity, in the fact that it is united in its diversity – as a threat to the notion of the nation state, or a threat to European identity, or to something else. It is not about that. I believe that this is an excellent initiative, and I would say that we need to know more about Europe. We need to know about one another, because in that way we can build a better Europe in the future. Europe is a mosaic of nations where common ideas about democracy, human dignity and freedom of opinion have developed. They are core values that we want to take forward. When we talk about the European cultural heritage, it has to be said that we have a very rich one. I believe that this small investment that we are making, EUR 1.3 million for the entire programme, will benefit those sites that acquire the European Heritage Label many times over, and even financially. The financial benefit is not what is most important here either: above all, it is the psychological benefit derived from a strengthened European spirit and a better understanding of how this Europe of mosaics was born and what its basis and foundation are.

In my view, it is an excellent and necessary one. Furthermore, it is well worth moving ahead with the European Heritage Label project on the basis of the report.","Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you for the opportunity to speak for a moment on behalf of my group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, about this important report on the European Heritage Label. Listening to the debate today, sometimes my impressions recalled what a certain teacher once told me: anything that can be misunderstood will be misunderstood. By this I mean that some try to see this excellent project – whose purpose is to raise Europe’s profile and show that Europe’s strength lies in its diversity, in the fact that it is united in its diversity – as a threat to the notion of the nation state, or a threat to European identity, or to something else. It is not about that. I believe that this is an excellent initiative, and I would say that we need to know more about Europe. We need to know about one another, because in that way we can build a better Europe in the future. Europe is a mosaic of nations where common ideas about democracy, human dignity and freedom of opinion have developed. They are core values that we want to take forward. When we talk about the European cultural heritage, it has to be said that we have a very rich one. I believe that this small investment that we are making, EUR 1.3 million for the entire programme, will benefit those sites that acquire the European Heritage Label many times over, and even financially. The financial benefit is not what is most important here either: above all, it is the psychological benefit derived from a strengthened European spirit and a better understanding of how this Europe of mosaics was born and what its basis and foundation are. When we know our background and history, then we will also be able to build a sustainable future. Mr President, again I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, for her report.

Georges Bach ,PPE,"Frau Präsidentin! Nach fünf Jahren Strategie Europa 2020 ist es an der Zeit, eine Bewertung vorzunehmen und aus den Fehlern der ersten Jahre zu lernen. Es ist nicht zu übersehen, dass wir vor allem im Bereich der Sozialpolitik noch weit von den gesteckten Zielen entfernt sind. Sicher, die Mitgliedstaaten sind verantwortlich für ihre jeweiligen sozial- und beschäftigungsbezogenen Systeme. Grundsätzlich bin ich mit dieser Kompetenzaufteilung auch einverstanden. Aber es wird immer deutlicher, dass die Mitgliedstaaten nicht schnell und effektiv genug und auch zum Teil sehr eigensinnig handeln. Ganz klar wird dies beispielsweise bei der Jugendgarantie bzw. bei anderen Initiativen für Jugendbeschäftigung. Fakt ist, dass die sozialen Indikatoren unbedingt gestärkt und womöglich verbindlich werden müssen, wenn wir die Ziele der Strategie überhaupt erreichen wollen. Ein anderes Thema, das mir besonders am Herzen liegt, ist die Armut und das immer größer werdende Risiko, in die Armut abzurutschen. Wir dürfen Armut nicht mit prekären Arbeitsplätzen bekämpfen, sondern wir müssen langfristige Lösungen finden. Aus diesem Grund ist es unentbehrlich, Wachstum zu fördern. Ich bin gespannt auf die Präsentation von Kommissionspräsident Jean-Claude Juncker morgen Vormittag und erwarte mit Spannung seine Vorschläge zum Investitionspakt – in der Hoffnung, dass die beschäftigungsbezogenen und sozialen Aspekte der Strategie Europa 2020 gestärkt und gefördert werden.","Frau Präsidentin!

They appeared before the press and Erdoğan took the occasion to speak strongly against the Istanbul Convention, with very offensive remarks about women. Mr Sánchez listened impassively, he smiled and uttered no words beyond friendship, investment or economic times. Erdoğan’s remarks were as offensive as his behaviour over the ‘sofagate’ scandal. But no one in Brussels has bothered to react, not even to express concern. This Spanish talk of friendship is a dangerous liaison indeed, and the Commission should be watching it, because beyond undermining the Istanbul Convention, the close friendship between Spain and Turkey is a threat to European security and stability much more widely. Spain sells Turkey the boats that threaten the security of Greece and Cyprus, and weapons that fuel the conflict in the Middle East. And meanwhile, Spanish banks are investing in a very volatile Turkish economy that can bring big risks to the eurozone.

I voted in favour of both of Mr De Castro’s reports because immediate, urgent intervention is required. However, we know that milk powder and butter have been stockpiled in the intervention stocks. They will be taken out of the intervention stocks and will only end up pushing down prices again. This is one problem I have. The other problem is that this measure is much more likely to help large farmers than small ones. We should not forget, however, that smallholders are in need of immediate help to make a basic living, whereas for larger farmers it would simply preserve or increase their profits. Fundamental changes are needed. We finally must guarantee food sovereignty instead of using the free trade model dictated by the WTO.

Kadri Simson,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the European Union strongly condemns the ongoing fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, which threatens the safety and security of the people of Sudan, as well as the unity and stability of the country and of the whole region. The EU deplores the loss of lives and the violations of international law, including international human rights law and international humanitarian law, calling on all actors to comply with international humanitarian law and implement an immediate cessation of hostilities without preconditions. Over two months into the fighting, at least 865 civilians have been killed, including 18 humanitarian workers and over 190 children. More than 6 000 people have been injured. 2 000 people may also have died in fighting in Darfur. Latest figures from the UN show that nearly 1.4 million people have been displaced by the conflict, 330 000 of whom have crossed into neighbouring countries. The humanitarian situation in Sudan has reached breaking point, with around 25 million people in Sudan – almost half of its total population – in urgent need of support, including 450 000 children already displaced. The EU is working with international partners to provide life-saving support to the most vulnerable, including women and children. Such is the case of about 300 infants, toddlers and older children rescued from an orphanage in Sudan’s capital after being trapped amidst fighting. The evacuation, carried out by the International Committee of the Red Cross and Unicef, came after 71 children died from hunger and illness in the facility since mid-April.  Procurement of traditional vaccines remains a critical gap in Sudan to ensuring the continuity of routine immunisation services and avoiding the outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases. I would like to commend the efforts to increase flexible humanitarian funding for partners who are maintaining their operations in Sudan. In 2023, the EU has already scaled up its support with EUR 73 million allocated in humanitarian assistance for Sudan. Following the outbreak of violence, the EU has mobilised EUR 200 000 for immediate relief and first-aid assistance to those injured or exposed to high risk. This EU emergency funding supports the Sudanese Red Crescent Society with first-aid evacuation services and psychosocial support, helping around 70 000 people in Khartoum, Northern State, North Kordofan, South Darfur and North Darfur. The EU is also supporting the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia and South Sudan. The EU has launched a humanitarian air bridge to facilitate the transport of life—saving supplies to our humanitarian partners. As of 1 June, three flights transporting 90 tonnes of essential supplies have arrived at Port Sudan from Dubai. These flights were organised with the support of the UN Humanitarian Response Depot, managed by the World Food Programme. The support provided by the humanitarian air bridge includes water, sanitation, hygiene and shelter items. The operation will allow our humanitarian partners on the ground to deliver immediate assistance to those in need. Moreover, another EU humanitarian air bridge is connecting Europe and Chad. A first flight from Munich to N’Djamena arrived on 31 May with 90 tonnes of supplies. This operation helps support the displaced population in Chad. More work is naturally being undertaken with neighbouring countries. Lastly, the EU calls on all actors to allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access, as well as to protect civilians and ensure the safety of humanitarian personnel. The fighting must end to guarantee their protection and allow space for dialogue and mediation. In this context, the EU supports efforts for an immediate cessation of hostilities, which will lead to a permanent ceasefire agreement, to be negotiated urgently.","Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the European Union strongly condemns the ongoing fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, which threatens the safety and security of the people of Sudan, as well as the unity and stability of the country and of the whole region.

Barbara Kappel ,ID,"Frau Präsidentin, Herr Kommissar, Frau Staatssekretärin! In der vergangenen Woche hat der Haushaltsausschuss einen MFR beschlossen, der 1,3 % des europäischen BIP ausmacht, das sind in aktuellen Preisen 1 324 Milliarden Euro und 190 Milliarden Euro mehr, als der Kommissionsvorschlag vorsah. Dabei war der Kommissionsvorschlag schon ambitioniert, denn der sah eine Mittelerhöhung von 48 Milliarden im Vergleich zum letzten MFR vor. Es wurde bei der Haushaltsplanung weder der Austritt Großbritanniens als zweitgrößter Nettozahler berücksichtigt, noch wurde eine Verschlankung der Strukturen in Angriff genommen. Stattdessen sollen neue Aufgaben und Prioritäten angenommen werden, die einen Mehrwert für Europa darstellen. Und das kostet. Die EU soll sich verstärkt um Themen wie Außengrenzschutz, Antiterror oder Verteidigung kümmern. Zehn Milliarden Euro werden hier pro Jahr veranschlagt. Für Forschung, Innovation und Digitales soll der neue Finanzplan um 60 % erhöht werden und für Erasmus+ um 50 %. Das sind gute und sinnvolle Prioritätensetzungen, die zu einem besseren Schutz der Bürger und zu mehr Wachstum und Beschäftigung führen.

Dabei war der Kommissionsvorschlag schon ambitioniert, denn der sah eine Mittelerhöhung von 48 Milliarden im Vergleich zum letzten MFR vor. Es wurde bei der Haushaltsplanung weder der Austritt Großbritanniens als zweitgrößter Nettozahler berücksichtigt, noch wurde eine Verschlankung der Strukturen in Angriff genommen. Stattdessen sollen neue Aufgaben und Prioritäten angenommen werden, die einen Mehrwert für Europa darstellen. Und das kostet. Die EU soll sich verstärkt um Themen wie Außengrenzschutz, Antiterror oder Verteidigung kümmern. Zehn Milliarden Euro werden hier pro Jahr veranschlagt. Für Forschung, Innovation und Digitales soll der neue Finanzplan um 60 % erhöht werden und für Erasmus+ um 50 %.

Jean-Pierre Audy ,PPE," I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague, Mr Böge, on the proposal for a decision on mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 13 million in order to help Ireland, which was hit by serious floods in November 2009. The amount of aid seems derisory to me (2.5% of an estimated EUR 500 million of total damage), and it has come far too late. I suggest that we ask ourselves whether, rather than granting derisory sums, we ought not to use part of them to finance a European civil protection force to come to the aid of States that are stricken by disasters that they are not equipped to deal with (fires, floods, natural disasters, cross-border disasters, and so on), or to carry out international cooperation efforts in the event of serious disasters such as that which occurred in Haiti, for example.","I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague, Mr Böge, on the proposal for a decision on mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 13 million in order to help Ireland, which was hit by serious floods in November 2009.

Paolo Gentiloni,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Madam President, Minister, honourable Members, let me first thank you, all of you, for your engagement, for transparency and accountability, not only this morning but at each and every single step of this unprecedented decision that we took one year ago. Your ambition and expectation as co-legislators of the RRF oblige us. It is my deep conviction that, without the political inputs of this House, its fight for EU added value and against fragmentation, we would never have achieved this crucial and unprecedented step. The Commission is the Guardian of the EU Treaties and the Parliament is the expression of the European citizens. Together, we are more than the addition of 27 national interests. We act to defend the European common good. Our intense cooperation on the recovery plans is cooperation for the recovery of Europe, to give hope to our citizens that to build back better our societies is possible. It is my utter conviction that the expectations raised and the commitments taken bind us. We have no choice but to deliver and to succeed, and your role is to ensure the parliamentary and public scrutiny in order to make this happen, and speed and scrutiny can and should coexist. We are bound by a legal framework that we are a co-legislator of, that assigns clear responsibilities and stringent timelines. I would like to reiterate that it is the prerogative of the college to give the assessment when deciding to adopt or not the proposal for a Council implementing decision, and the regulation as agreed between Parliament and Council doesn’t foresee a preliminary assessment, as Valdis just underlined. Let me add also that we will strongly reflect on the way Member States approach the consultation process. This is important to ensure a lasting impact of reforms and investment by creating broad ownership. The active involvement of stakeholders will be vital throughout all the stages of the implementation process, and the submission of the national recovery plan is only the first step. Also, the involvement of local authorities is crucial for having successful implementation of the plan. For instance, Member States have an obligation to ensure close cooperation with regional levels to achieve the objectives of the facility, and the Commission will pay close attention to this, because the success of this very important operation will not be achieved behind closed doors. It should be achieved with involvement at national and European level. What we can certainly say and what one can see, reading the plans which have been presented, is that all plans so far address the six pillars, but with different emphasis on the individual six pillars. I would like to underline that the plans have to explain how Member States will strengthen job creation and their economic and social resilience in the long term, and contribute to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights. Honourable Members, Parliament has access to the full plans. We very much encourage the Members, with your unique expertise and understanding, to provide your views in the context of the recovery and resilience dialogue or through resolutions. We have a very short time but we can do this, I think, in this short time. The preparation of the RRPs has somehow created a new form of dialogue between the Commission and Member States, and I really thank the Presidency of the Council for this. It is to be welcomed that this translates also into a strong engagement for the accountability of the Commission towards Parliament. For sure, we are fully committed to report to this House, its plenary, competent parliamentary committees and dedicated bodies, and this debate is a confirmation of this. Concluding, let me stress one thing: we are all doing something new. We are learning something new – new resources, new procedures, new shared responsibility and accountability. We will certainly jointly improve what is to improve, but we have common principles, purpose and priorities, ensuring the conditions for a swift and sustainable recovery of our common economy.","Member of the Commission. – Madam President, Minister, honourable Members, let me first thank you, all of you, for your engagement, for transparency and accountability, not only this morning but at each and every single step of this unprecedented decision that we took one year ago.

Clemente Mastella ,PPE," This report invites us to consider the very function of cinema in Europe and its role in the creation and sustainability of a civil society. We are called on to support it and to commit to granting the widest possible access to citizens in the name of unity and freedom of thought. European cinema is facing its biggest challenge to date: coping with the requirements of modern technology, including the arrival of the digital era. Modern technologies are changing the audiovisual sector, creating challenges and possibilities for production, distribution and accessibility. In this transition from analogue to digital cinema, operators in both the public and the private sectors in all the Member States should unite at a national as well as an EU level. Parliament should initiate this paradigm shift by making a financial input. One of the most important financing instruments is the Structural Funds. Therefore, we call for an appropriate level of support to be included in the new multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020. Another significant instrument is the availability of preferential credit rates offered by the European Investment Bank to cinemas with insufficient funds for the digitisation process.","This report invites us to consider the very function of cinema in Europe and its role in the creation and sustainability of a civil society.

Peter Lundgren,ID,"Herr talman! Som företrädare för en euroskeptisk grupp är det klart att det här inte är den optimala lösningen för mig. Jag skulle hellre se att man ordnade mycket av det här på nationell nivå, men nu är det som det är och det finns bra grejer i det här, t.ex. den döda vinkeln – det är ett stort bekymmer som lastbilschaufför, som jag själv har varit i 30 år. Det är ett mycket stort bekymmer att man inte ser cyklister och gående vid sidan om lastbilen tätt intill. En nu utformning kan ha stora fördelar, faktiskt, för chauffören.  Viktkontrollen är också en grej som är bra, för det är också chauffören som hängs. Varje gång man blir stoppad i en poliskontroll så är det chauffören som bär det yttersta ansvaret för hur mycket vikt man har på lastbile. Så det ser jag också som en bra grej. Sedan vill jag då komma till det man kallar för ”megatrucks”. Det är beklämmande att höra herr Taylor stå och köra fram ren hatpropaganda mot det vi kallar för ”megatrucks”. Jag är själv från Sverige. Vi har ett land som inte har så fruktansvärt stort utbyggd järnväg. Vi är fullständigt beroende av lastbilar, och det mest miljövänliga alternativet är ju så klart att ha så mycket gods som möjligt på lastbilen. Att det skulle fördärva infrastrukturen, ja men det begriper du väl att det har att göra med hur många axlar du har på fordonet. Fördelar du vikten på fler axlar har du inte heller några som helst problem med vägskador. Och låt mig poängtera: De lastbilar vi har problem med i Sverige under vinterperioden t.ex. är inte de som kallas för ”megatrucks”. Det är de tvåaxliga Europadragarna – småbilarna från Europa – som är det stora bekymret, inte de stora lastbilarna.","Herr talman!

Det är ett mycket stort bekymmer att man inte ser cyklister och gående vid sidan om lastbilen tätt intill. En nu utformning kan ha stora fördelar, faktiskt, för chauffören. Viktkontrollen är också en grej som är bra, för det är också chauffören som hängs. Varje gång man blir stoppad i en poliskontroll så är det chauffören som bär det yttersta ansvaret för hur mycket vikt man har på lastbile. Så det ser jag också som en bra grej. Sedan vill jag då komma till det man kallar för ”megatrucks”. Det är beklämmande att höra herr Taylor stå och köra fram ren hatpropaganda mot det vi kallar för ”megatrucks”. Jag är själv från Sverige. Vi har ett land som inte har så fruktansvärt stort utbyggd järnväg. Vi är fullständigt beroende av lastbilar, och det mest miljövänliga alternativet är ju så klart att ha så mycket gods som möjligt på lastbilen. Att det skulle fördärva infrastrukturen, ja men det begriper du väl att det har att göra med hur många axlar du har på fordonet. Fördelar du vikten på fler axlar har du inte heller några som helst problem med vägskador. Och låt mig poängtera: De lastbilar vi har problem med i Sverige under vinterperioden t.ex. är inte de som kallas för ”megatrucks”. Det är de tvåaxliga Europadragarna – småbilarna från Europa – som är det stora bekymret, inte de stora lastbilarna.","Herr talman!

João Ferreira ,GUE/NGL," The joint resolution signed and adopted by the main political groups – conservatives, social democrats, liberals and even the greens – reflects the objectives of strengthening the Schengen Information System, Frontex and an entire security-oriented immigration policy based essentially on the criminalisation of immigration, with the inhumane consequences that we unfortunately know all too well. This insistence on reinforcing Schengen governance comes at a time when the situation in Lampedusa and the thousands of victims and refugees from conflicts and wars in Africa are in plain sight. These are wars that the EU itself is supporting and in which several of its countries are participating. More cooperation, solidarity and dialogue are necessary, but that is not the path laid out in this report. On top of all this, there is an insistence on common asylum and migration policies, on the pretext of combating illegal immigration and organised crime.

Ernest Maragall,Greens/EFA,"Señor Presidente, yo creo que estamos coincidiendo todos bastante en la valoración y el diagnóstico de lo que quiere decir hoy voluntariado en Europa y de lo que puede querer decir, de las potencias evidentes del concepto y de la realidad.  Veinte años. Cien mil voluntarios en el Servicio Voluntario Europeo. Cinco años desde el primer Año Europeo de las Actividades de Voluntariado. La propuesta de Resolución habla de cien millones estimados de voluntarios y de un 5 % del PIB. Es una estimación.  Yo creo que una de las cuestiones —también lo dice la propuesta de Resolución— es que hay que estudiar más y hay que conocer mejor el fenómeno, porque parece claro que estamos siendo conscientes un poco de la punta del iceberg, una punta positiva, extraordinaria, pero que seguramente esconde realidades y situaciones. En fin, que lleva mensajes muy contradictorios también.  Déjenme decirles que, en alguna medida, el éxito o la apariencia de éxito del concepto de voluntariado en Europa —por ejemplo, en mi propio país de una manera muy espectacular— es también una medida, un indicador de los déficits sociales, de las necesidades no cubiertas, de las situaciones de drama personal, individual y colectivo que nuestras sociedades muchas veces siguen comportando. Allí donde no llega el Estado o donde el mercado produce desastres, allí aparece, efectivamente y afortunadamente, el voluntariado que, en buena parte, no solo añade sino que sustituye.  En todo caso, tengamos claro que hay este valor de sustitución, que hay este valor de ocupar el espacio que quizá podría y debería ser ocupado naturalmente de otra manera, y entonces el voluntariado podría efectivamente dedicarse simplemente a añadir, a enriquecer, a cooperar, a crear Europa, y sería aún mejor de lo que ya es ahora.  Yo creo que hay que destacar también los elementos de esa necesidad de reconocimiento que el voluntariado tiene en el sentido de acceso a la profesionalidad, de reconocimiento de capacidades. Y en ese sentido es donde yo creo que Europa, la Unión Europea, puede y debe hacer claramente más de lo que hace ahora. Debemos asumir la responsabilidad de crear un marco, de estimular la movilidad, de estimular la cooperación, de estimular el aprendizaje, de estimular la coordinación también de legalidades y de regulaciones nacionales.  Miren, el voluntariado es un fenómeno básicamente local. Aparece, nace y crece muy cerca, en la realidad misma, como respuesta a necesidades evidentes apreciadas localmente. Hay que evitar un cierto riesgo —cómo diría— de prepotencia institucional, de que desde aquí vamos a organizarlo todo, de que desde aquí vamos a saber exactamente cómo tienen que ser las cosas.

Un día, la Guardia Costera italiana viene a explicarnos su actividad, magnífica, en el Mediterráneo de salvación, de recuperación de refugiados en el mar y, al día siguiente, viene la ONG catalana, española, Proactiva Open Arms, que no es que complemente, es que añade valor. Es imprescindible; aquí no hay complementariedad: es una necesidad total. Sin esa ONG, los muertos en el Mediterráneo serían miles más porque los barcos militares no pueden hacer el trabajo que hacen estos voluntarios.

The amendments that have been made will allow greater flexibility in the structure of sectoral annexes and remove unnecessary restrictions on trade between the parties.

Monika Flašíková Beňová ,S&D," Madam President, the budget is a key instrument for European integration, and how it is set therefore matters.

I would like to point out, however, that they should not be regarded as an alternative to Eurobonds.

An opposite tendency – towards disintegration – would result from, for example, attempts to slash EU budget levels. In addition to the unfavourable economic impacts, these attempts also undermine solidarity between Member States.

Hannes Swoboda,S&D,"Mr President, first of all I want to thank the rapporteurs because they have made it very clear how important a European strategy is. Targeting the French, the Italians and others is not useful. We need a strong European strategy; that is what the rapporteurs say and that is very important. But the question really is: is this strategy embedded in a long-term vision for Europe? Yes, as the President of the Commission said, there is some improvement at the growth level but there are still many people in Europe who think that inflation is the big problem. Deflation may be a big problem very soon, and if the ECB is to be criticised over anything, it is perhaps that they underestimate, as the Commission does, the deflation in Europe.  Mass unemployment is still here, especially for the younger generation too. Here is the one point on which I agree with President Barroso, because I see that many Member States do not use the money delivered by Parliament and the Council under what is, admittedly, a pragmatic agreement for the Youth Guarantee. It is important to invest this, important that the money should go there. Unemployment is still much too high in most countries.  But it is not only unemployment, there are also social issues; social issues will have to be on the agenda: poverty, child poverty and health risk. Now neither the Commission President nor the Vice-President are listening and I can understand that they do not listen because they do not want to hear – I am speaking to Mr[nbsp ]Rehn here – that nearly 30% of children are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. What are you going to do about that? Do you know that you will not defeat child poverty with your policy? Infant mortality in Greece – I now address the Minister – has increased by 43%! This is not only a result of the crisis but also of the European Union’s crisis policy: to raise infant mortality, something that is catastrophic in the European Union. This is what we should talk about.  President Barroso is right that it would be dishonest not to speak about progress, but it would be at least equally dishonest not to speak about the social problems created by the austerity policy we have in Europe today. Now the G20 said that an additional 2% growth is needed annually. How will that happen with the kind of policies we have? We would need much more investment to have at least 2% additional growth in Europe or worldwide. For example, in education: the Minister spoke about education at the meeting of the Education Ministers. But do you know, Minister – sorry to bring this up, it is not your personal responsibility – and does the Commission know that in at least 20 EU Member States education expenditure today is less as a percentage of GDP than it was before? In 20 Member States education expenditure is less as a percentage of GDP and you want to speak about growth! If you do not spend more on education in science and research we will not get more growth. This is the situation in Europe today and I do not know what your strategy is about. So let me come to the conclusion, because I do not think that what we have heard today is up to the level of what needs to be done in Europe today. They are nice words but we need action; we need action in the sense of growth policy by investment, with action for employment, including action from the European budget; I agree on that point.  We also need action on the fight against poverty. I know Mr Barroso fought for poverty to be included in the Europe 2020 Strategy but now we have to fight not just for it to be included in words, but included in deeds. A strong fight against poverty, especially child poverty, and against youth unemployment: those are the things we have to do but here we lack clear action from both the Commission and the Council.

But do you know, Minister – sorry to bring this up, it is not your personal responsibility – and does the Commission know that in at least 20 EU Member States education expenditure today is less as a percentage of GDP than it was before? In 20 Member States education expenditure is less as a percentage of GDP and you want to speak about growth! If you do not spend more on education in science and research we will not get more growth. This is the situation in Europe today and I do not know what your strategy is about. So let me come to the conclusion, because I do not think that what we have heard today is up to the level of what needs to be done in Europe today. They are nice words but we need action; we need action in the sense of growth policy by investment, with action for employment, including action from the European budget; I agree on that point. We also need action on the fight against poverty. I know Mr Barroso fought for poverty to be included in the Europe 2020 Strategy but now we have to fight not just for it to be included in words, but included in deeds. A strong fight against poverty, especially child poverty, and against youth unemployment: those are the things we have to do but here we lack clear action from both the Commission and the Council. )","Mr President, first of all I want to thank the rapporteurs because they have made it very clear how important a European strategy is. Targeting the French, the Italians and others is not useful. We need a strong European strategy; that is what the rapporteurs say and that is very important. But the question really is: is this strategy embedded in a long-term vision for Europe? Yes, as the President of the Commission said, there is some improvement at the growth level but there are still many peo",Economy

Deirdre Clune,PPE," – Madam President, the single market emergency instrument is a critical piece of legislation, and it not only draws on the lessons from COVID-19, but also equips the European Union to better prepare for future crisis. The pandemic revealed the inadequacy of national approaches to effectively tackle a crisis of such magnitude. We saw border closures, procurement hurdles and export controls. This Parliament has recognised that an instrument is needed for rapid and decisive action during times of crisis, and it introduces a system of alert levels that will foster collaboration between the European Commission and Member States. This collaboration approach is pivotal in both preventing and mitigating crisis and ensuring that the EU can respond swiftly to emerging challenges. We saw the value of collaboration during COVID. So during a crisis this instrument will empower the Commission to implement a range of measures aimed at safeguarding the principles of the single market: free movement of goods, services and people across Europe. Furthermore, it guarantees the availability of crucial crisis-relevant goods, something we learned during the pandemic. The instrument will facilitate the availability of essential goods by enabling priority orders and necessitates close coordination again among Member States in their crisis response. So we will have a clear framework for joint procurement, learning from the vaccines experience during the crisis. It builds on the lessons of the past, equips us with the tools we need to respond swiftly, decisively and collaboratively when we face a new risk or a new crisis, so we can ensure that our single market remains open and fair, and goods of vital importance remain available to meet the needs of the people of Europe.","– Madam President, the single market emergency instrument is a critical piece of legislation, and it not only draws on the lessons from COVID-19, but also equips the European Union to better prepare for future crisis.

Frances Fitzgerald,PPE," – Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent contribution.  This debate is on trafficking, but let’s be clear what we’re talking about today: modern day slavery. Trafficking is nothing less than modern day slavery here in our Europe. Slavery that moves as much money as drugs, but instead moves young women into Europe, and from east to west in Europe.  It is for this reason that I cannot understand why it is not at the very top of the European political agenda. Modern day slavery in Europe requires intense and persistent action to combat it, comprehensive action within the criminal justice agencies backed by adequate resources, Member State cooperation – working hand-in-hand – and political commitment, permanent commitment, until it is eradicated. This is how we tackle modern slavery in Europe. But what specific actions can we take? Recognise prostitution as violence against women. As Minister for Justice in Ireland, I introduced legislation that criminalises the buyer and not the seller of sex. This model puts pressure on traffickers. Every Member State should do that.  Introduce an EU criminal assets agency and follow the money. That’s what we have to do, a stand-alone directive on sexual exploitation. When women are violated consistently, we call this rape. To adequately combat this unique and horrific crime a stand-alone directive is needed.  The criminal justice agencies must work closely together, tracking the gangs who carry out the trafficking. It’s long and painstaking work but it must be done and we must support victims. The horror stories are endless. We cannot stand for modern day slavery in our Europe. We need to combat it with full force. ","– Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent contribution.

Sandra Kalniete,N/A,"rapporteur. – Mr President, today, Europe faces two major, transformative crises which will shape our future for many years to come – the COVID—19 pandemic and Russia’s unprovoked, brutal war against Ukraine. There is one crucial, dark, vicious common denominator for both – the widespread, coordinated and systematic spread of hostile and targeted disinformation. Since we have discussed several times the consequences of COVID—19 disinformation campaigns, today I will concentrate more on the Kremlin’s propaganda machinery working in overdrive to justify Putin’s unprovoked act of aggression, shredding of international law and sending thousands of Russian people to an irrational and deadly war. And let’s call a spade a spade. Putin’s propaganda machinery was not ‘turned on’ only on February 24th, it has been working in Europe for decades already, attempting to poison and divide our societies. With all this in mind, we have arrived at the moment of truth to ask a frank question – how did the democratic world get to this point? And how we can prevent it in the future? This is exactly the task of our report, which will be voted today, and I invite everyone to appreciate the great urgency of the moment. Dear members of the House, the report identifies and maps the threat of foreign interference in all of its forms, including disinformation, manipulation of social media platforms and advertising systems, cyber—attacks, threats against and the harassment of journalists, covert political funding and elite capture and co-optation. In other words, this report both provides the diagnosis of the EU’s vulnerabilities and prescribes the medication for strengthening the EU’s resilience. A few words about platforms and data markets. We have to shed light on the black box of social media platforms: we need truly binding EU rules for algorithms for accountability and transparency, particularly when it comes to the demonetisation of harmful content and data accountability. Today, while the war is ongoing in Europe, online platforms and tech companies need to take a stand by proactively suspending accounts engaged in denying, glorifying and justifying aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity. They have to reinforce content in Russian and Ukrainian languages to resist the pressure from Russian government’s disinformation. In short, any tech platform complying with Putin’s censorship request is an accomplice to Putin’s aggression. I would also like to highlight the need for data market accountability and transparency, including binding EU rules to limit the amount of data platforms can harvest, store and sell. It is completely unacceptable that loosely, regulated commercial entities can sell data of Europeans, me, you, all of us to the same authoritarian regimes that are trying to tear us apart. About resilience, we see that the Kremlin is attempting to insulate, wall off the Russian information space, by imposing new censorship rules. This shows that Putin is threatened by any independent media and narrative. This is a clear signal that we should double, triple and quadruple our support for quality and independent media, including in the EU’s neighbourhood. The Kremlin is also operating with extensive cyber warfare tools. That’s why we need to step up cybersecurity assistance to Ukraine, deploying there cyber rapid response team experts and using the EU cyber sanctions regime against individuals, entities and bodies responsible or involved in the various cyber—attacks targeting Ukraine. The resilience of our societies is absolutely key here. We must not allow any malicious actor to exploit our freedoms. Therefore, resilience, awareness and media literacy must be built up as our protective shields. Another factor weakening our resilience is foreign covert funding, elite capture and co—optation. For decades, we have watched former high—ranking European officials and politicians take up prominent positions on Russian energy companies, while we were channelling hundreds of millions into Putin’s coffers and providing safe haven for his cronies and oligarchs. Look where that has gotten us. We, with our euros, have effectively built and financed Putin’s war machine, which is now being used to slaughter innocent Ukrainians. If we don’t turn off the flow of gas and oil ‘golden river’ now, then we deserve the full consequences of our greed and sorry stupidity. And to conclude, dear colleagues, I was harsh, but I am convinced that we across the political groups, together with the Member States and the Commission, can move forward towards implementation of the report’s recommendations with utmost urgency. And I would like warmly to thank all my shadows, chair of the Committee and Secretariat and our councillors.","rapporteur. – Mr President, today, Europe faces two major, transformative crises which will shape our future for many years to come – the COVID—19 pandemic and Russia’s unprovoked, brutal war against Ukraine. There is one crucial, dark, vicious common denominator for both – the widespread, coordinated and systematic spread of hostile and targeted disinformation. Since we have discussed several times the consequences of COVID—19 disinformation campaigns, today I will concentrate more on the Kremlin’s propaganda machinery working in overdrive to justify Putin’s unprovoked act of aggression, shredding of international law and sending thousands of Russian people to an irrational and deadly war. And let’s call a spade a spade. Putin’s propaganda machinery was not ‘turned on’ only on February 24th, it has been working in Europe for decades already, attempting to poison and divide our societies.

Jarosław Wałęsa ,PPE,"Mr President, the Office of the European Ombudsman deals with instances of maladministration in the activities of the European institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. In 2015, the Ombudsman helped over 17 000 Europeans, mostly from Spain, Germany, Poland and Belgium. In addition, the Ombudsman launched 17 own-initiative inquiries regarding major issues on the EU agenda, such as TTIP transparency, whistleblowing or the European Citizens’ Initiative. It is also important to mention that the activities of the European Network of Ombudsmen has been increased to include the national and regional ombudsmen, aimed at fostering cooperation and conducting parallel investigations in important subjects such as the forced return of illegal immigrants.  I would also like to congratulate the Ombudsman on the initiative of the Award for Good Administration that was inspired by the examples of exemplary administration carried out by civil servants. The Ombudsman wants to underline the fact that useful work for citizens goes sometimes unnoticed because of distance and that good practice is not shared within the administration. I hope that this award will help to refocus the situation and I firmly support this reinforcement. It is a good way to show our appreciation for these good practices. I wish the Ombudsman further success and dedication in everyday work and I wish her good luck because her work has been exemplary. I wish her all the best in continuing the work.","Mr President, the Office of the European Ombudsman deals with instances of maladministration in the activities of the European institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.

It is still extremely difficult for women who have children, to be able to enjoy their family life and take care of their children as well as to maintain their ambition in their careers.

Mick Wallace,GUE/NGL," – Mr President, this motion talks about supporting the resilience and post-crisis recovery of the EU’s cultural ecosystem as a whole, and I was very happy to vote in favour of it. There’s been a significant increase in the Creative Europe Programme budget to 2.4 billion for the 2021—2027 period, almost double the previous amount. However, despite this increase in funding, Ireland remains in the bottom rung of European investment in culture, sadly. As one of the hardest hit sectors by Covid, the arts and cultural sector in Ireland has seen far—reaching and damaging consequences in terms of jobs, tourism and regional development. There is basically an arts recession in Ireland. In the cost of living crisis in Europe, it is more timely than ever to ensure the livelihood of people working in the cultural sector. There is a desperate need across the board for robust recovery mechanisms with targeted funding if anything is going to change. We love to talk about the arts in Ireland, but we don’t love to support it, and that is a real problem.","– Mr President, this motion talks about supporting the resilience and post-crisis recovery of the EU’s cultural ecosystem as a whole, and I was very happy to vote in favour of it.

È sempre più evidente che i supporters di Greta fanno i bravi ecologisti, però con i portafogli degli altri. Sono i cittadini e i consumatori a pagare gli aumenti delle bollette e anche gli aumenti in generale dei prezzi dei prodotti, così come pagano i centinaia di migliaia di lavoratori, che sono evidentemente ritenuti sacrificabili sull'altare della transizione ecologica. Sia chiaroche è un bene che i giovani siano più responsabili sul futuro del pianeta, ma l'Unione europea dovrebbe essere, come dire, più concentrata sulla realtà. Le imprese europee pagano l'energia molto di più dei competitor internazionali e invece non fate assolutamente nulla con i paesi che inquinano di più, come Cina e India, con i quali invece continuate a sottoscrivere accordi commerciali. Allo stesso tempo, ovviamente, consentire alla Cina di mettere le mani sull'energia solare gli consente di avere un monopolio su quel tipo di produzione. Insomma, in pratica il futuro è grigio. Vi chiediamo più coerenza e di non discriminare le aziende e i cittadini europei.","– Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, l'ambientalismo ideologico dell'Unione europea produce solo disastri.

Malik Azmani,ALDE,"on behalf of the Renew Group. – Mr President, the Turkish military operation in north-eastern Syria is cause for a great concern and is leading to chaos in the region. Reports speak of hundreds of casualties, hundreds of thousands of displaced people, and even of executions. ISIS terrorists have escaped prison and as a direct result of the Turkish move and the US withdrawal, revival of ISIS and the possible return of these terrorists to European soil presents also an immediate safety threat to our societies, for our citizens. By asking questions to the European Commission, by sending a letter to the High Representative Ms Mogherini, which was widely supported by more than 250 colleagues – and I am grateful for that – and by engaging with the Turkish authorities, I have in the past weeks attempted on behalf of Renew Europe to contribute to ending this violence. But so far, the EU’s response has not been strong enough. We cannot just stand by and see how others interfere, for example, Russia, Assad, Iran. It’s also our safety that is at stake. For Renew Europe, the road does not end here. Tomorrow, the European Parliament has the unique opportunity to speak with one clear voice, one voice to make perfectly clear to Turkey that we do not accept this, and to call upon the EU to take a strong stance now.  I ask my colleagues in this House to support me in urging the High Representative to set up an immediate dialogue with the Turkish authorities, to reach a sustainable solution, and to hold Erdoğan to his promise of keeping ISIS prisoners in detention. However, we must be prepared for firmer action. Arms, economic and targeted sanctions are also on the table. Let us combine our strength and show unity and bring an end to the violence now. We owe it to the people in the region and to our European citizens. Please, Commission, get off the side-line and act.","on behalf of the Renew Group. – Mr President, the Turkish military operation in north-eastern Syria is cause for a great concern and is leading to chaos in the region.

Bas Eickhout,Greens/EFA," – Madam President, I will conclude here what appears to be a Dutch round, so I’m the last of the four.  We had a lot of discussion on the discharge on the agencies. Of course, a lot of discussion went on Frontex. Well, we’ve seen, of course, some of the developments and Director Leggeri stepping down, but that doesn’t mean that the problems in Frontex are being solved. I really think that also even the way he stepped down shows that still within Frontex there is no clear perception that they are supposed also to take into full consideration human rights. That’s not because we want a human rights agency; we want to be sure that our borders are being protected in full alignment with the human rights. I think that really deserves a cultural change, and I think there our report is also very clear why we postponed the discharge and on what criteria we’re doing it.  I just want to use the last 10 minutes to really look to the Commission. For the Greens, discharge on the Commission will be linked to what you do on the rule of law. Really, Commissioner Hahn, you need to step up and have a broad interpretation of the conditionality mechanism, not the narrow legalistic one.","– Madam President, I will conclude here what appears to be a Dutch round, so I’m the last of the four.

That’s not because we want a human rights agency; we want to be sure that our borders are being protected in full alignment with the human rights. I think that really deserves a cultural change, and I think there our report is also very clear why we postponed the discharge and on what criteria we’re doing it. I just want to use the last 10 minutes to really look to the Commission. For the Greens, discharge on the Commission will be linked to what you do on the rule of law. Really, Commissioner Hahn, you need to step up and have a broad interpretation of the conditionality mechanism, not the narrow legalistic one.","– Madam President, I will conclude here what appears to be a Dutch round, so I’m the last of the four. We had a lot of discussion on the discharge on the agencies. Of course, a lot of discussion went on Frontex.

Ska Keller ,Greens/EFA,"Madam President, I think we all agree that racism has no place in Europe. As a German, let me say that the work and the hard fight of those who resisted the Nazi regime deserve all our honour. (Applause) The Council meeting on Monday was a disgrace, I am afraid to say. It was certainly not the fault of the Presidency or a lack of work on their part. On Monday it was national egoisms that won out. European solidarity and the refugees themselves were on the losing side – people who are fleeing from war and terrorism who are currently being turned away at our borders. This is unacceptable if we want to uphold the Europe of freedom, solidarity and human rights. The Council needs to act now because what is at stake is our own credibility.

Sylvie Brunet,ALDE," – Monsieur le Président, il est important que nous ayons aujourd'hui ce débat, dans un contexte de multiplication des actes discriminatoires, notamment homophobes, dans tous nos pays. Notre Europe est fondée sur des valeurs; nous souhaitons protéger les catégories les plus vulnérables de notre société et lutter contre toutes les formes de discrimination. Or, ce sont les femmes, les personnes handicapées, les personnes LGBTI et les minorités ethniques qui sont souvent les plus exposées au risque de discrimination.  En son temps, la Commission a lancé une proposition plus large car l'égalité de traitement était couverte uniquement dans les domaines de l'emploi et du travail. En 2009, le Parlement a fait sa part du travail. Je tiens à rappeler en particulier ici son souci d'élargir le champ couvert par le texte afin de lutter efficacement contre les discriminations multiples ou encore les discriminations par association, car beaucoup de personnes sont exposées au risque de double discrimination.  Le problème est que le texte a depuis lors, comme vous le savez, été bloqué au Conseil. Il est important que cette directive soit débloquée car nous devons parler de droits concrets et effectifs. Le texte concerne l'accès à la protection sociale, à l'éducation, aux biens et aux services, tels que le logement, par exemple. J'espère que le signal envoyé par notre Parlement a été entendu aujourd'hui.","– Monsieur le Président, il est important que nous ayons aujourd'hui ce débat, dans un contexte de multiplication des actes discriminatoires, notamment homophobes, dans tous nos pays.

Axel Voss,N/A,"Verfasser der Stellungnahme des mitberatenden Rechtsausschusses. – Herr Präsident, Frau Vizepräsidentin, Herr Kommissar! Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, recht herzlichen Dank auch für die ganze Zusammenarbeit, die uns zu einem Kompromiss gebracht hat. Die Wichtigkeit von KI muss man noch einmal, glaube ich, herausstellen. Das ist die Grundlage jeglicher Entwicklungen, die wir in der Zukunft im Digitalen haben werden. Deshalb ist die Balance hier richtig: Es muss ausgewogen und es muss praxisnah sein. Während im KI-Weißbuch 2020 noch von einem Ökosystem der Exzellenz und einem Ökosystem des Vertrauens gesprochen wurde, haben wir hier in dem Vorschlag eigentlich nur noch das Ökosystem des Vertrauens, dazu die oftmals angstgetriebenen Vorschläge. Das macht das ganze Projekt aus meiner Sicht noch zu unausgewogen. Wie wollen wir so letztlich auch zur KI-Weltspitze aufschließen? Das, was wir heute auf dem Tisch liegen haben und worüber wir morgen abstimmen werden, bedarf meines Erachtens zusätzlicher Maßnahmen, damit das auch für unsere Industrie am Ende zu einer Erfolgsgeschichte werden kann. Die Kommission und die Standardisierungsorganisationen müssen nun rechtzeitig die essenziellen Orientierungshilfen ergreifen und technische Standards bereitstellen. In den Trilogverhandlungen sollten wir meines Erachtens noch die Überschneidungen und Widersprüche mit vielen anderen Digitalgesetzen und sektoriellen Regelungen konsequent identifizieren und auch beheben. Es muss meines Erachtens auch sichergestellt werden, dass innerhalb der Europäischen Union tatsächlich dieselben Regeln gelten. Wir sollten also die Fehler der DSGVO hier nicht wiederholen.

Deshalb ist die Balance hier richtig: Es muss ausgewogen und es muss praxisnah sein. Während im KI-Weißbuch 2020 noch von einem Ökosystem der Exzellenz und einem Ökosystem des Vertrauens gesprochen wurde, haben wir hier in dem Vorschlag eigentlich nur noch das Ökosystem des Vertrauens, dazu die oftmals angstgetriebenen Vorschläge. Das macht das ganze Projekt aus meiner Sicht noch zu unausgewogen. Wie wollen wir so letztlich auch zur KI-Weltspitze aufschließen? Das, was wir heute auf dem Tisch liegen haben und worüber wir morgen abstimmen werden, bedarf meines Erachtens zusätzlicher Maßnahmen, damit das auch für unsere Industrie am Ende zu einer Erfolgsgeschichte werden kann. Die Kommission und die Standardisierungsorganisationen müssen nun rechtzeitig die essenziellen Orientierungshilfen ergreifen und technische Standards bereitstellen. In den Trilogverhandlungen sollten wir meines Erachtens noch die Überschneidungen und Widersprüche mit vielen anderen Digitalgesetzen und sektoriellen Regelungen konsequent identifizieren und auch beheben. Es muss meines Erachtens auch sichergestellt werden, dass innerhalb der Europäischen Union tatsächlich dieselben Regeln gelten. Wir sollten also die Fehler der DSGVO hier nicht wiederholen.

Acabo de hablar, hace tan solo dos horas, con Denis Mukwege y me ha pedido que este Parlamento intervenga: necesita protección. Desde el 16 de noviembre su situación no ha parado de empeorar. Mukwege recibe constantes amenazas, intimidaciones vía telefónica, vía SMS y la situación de seguridad de su hospital y de su persona corren grave riesgo. Todavía resuenan aquí las palabras de Denis Mukwege cuando recibió el Premio Sájarov, resuenan en nuestras cabezas y en nuestras conciencias. Es el momento de que este Parlamento y la Unión Europea tomen medidas contundentes contra la situación que se está produciendo en la República Democrática del Congo. No podemos dar el Premio Sájarov a Denis Mukwege y abandonarle ahora ante una evidente falta de seguridad para su persona y para los pacientes. Denis Mukwege ha denunciado en los últimos meses el incremento de violaciones de niños y niñas menores de cinco años: eso es lo que está sucediendo.

Un constat s’impose: la législation relative aux pesticide n’est pas correctement appliquée par les États membres. Le recours abusif, notamment, aux autorisations d’urgence doit cesser. En Belgique, c’est le recours à cette procédure, prévue à l’article 53, qui justifie qu’une substance aussi dangereuse pour les voies respiratoires que la chloropicrine soit encore utilisée sur les fraisiers en plein champ. Cela nous renvoie à l’application du principe de précaution qui, je le rappelle, est un principe d’action et non un encouragement à ne pas bouger, à ne rien faire.

Edit Herczog ,S&D," The most important requirements are that the activities of the European Investment Bank be even more transparent for the European Parliament and that the financial instruments outsourced by it be used in an even more targeted manner. We recommend for consideration the proposal that prudential supervision be introduced for this institution as well in the interest of the precise measurement of the quality of the EIB’s financial situation and its results, as well as compliance with effective and successful business practice. I would like to stress that we are not making this proposal because we have doubts about the regularity of the EIB’s activity but because, in our view, as a general rule, as the G20’s London Declaration clearly stated two years ago, ‘all systemically important financial institutions, markets, and instruments should be subject to an appropriate degree of regulation and oversight’. We suggest calling on the European Commission to provide the European Parliament with the legal analysis of the options for the prudential supervision of the EIB by 30 November 2011, because under the effective legislation, no European institution has the right to supervise the EIB. However, in view of the increased role of the EIB, and also because of the extension of EU guarantees to it, changing this urgently is warranted. It would be justified to develop increased professional and social supervision, similarly to the practice which has evolved in recent times at other non-bank financial institutions. The EIB’s lending activity needs to become more selective, more effective and more result-oriented in the future, particularly as regards financing SMEs. To this end, information on loans granted must also be collected and published more systematically.","The most important requirements are that the activities of the European Investment Bank be even more transparent for the European Parliament and that the financial instruments outsourced by it be used in an even more targeted manner.

Sophia in ’t Veld,ALDE,"Mr President, I would like to say this to our colleague Mr Legutko: I think that eight minutes of filibustering, caricature and ridicule will probably get you a lot of airtime on Polish television, but you are not actually doing anything for the interests of the Polish people. I would like to underline the fact that this debate today is not about Poland, and we have had similar debates about situations in other countries, as you know full well. What this is about, and I will quote the Council Presidency – pay attention because I rarely ever quote the Council Presidency – who said that ‘the issues at stake go to the heart of our commitment to the Union’. That, Mr Legutko, is what we are talking about today. The situation that we are going through might be described as the growing pains of a community of values that is developing. We readily accept that the Commission intervenes in matters of tax evasion, state aid, or disrespect for environmental standards. But then we say – and Mr Timmermans always says – we have to be big on big things. This is big. This goes right to the heart of what the European Union is all about: about the rule of law, about fundamental rights, and about democracy. In this sense, I would give full support to the initiative of Commissioner Timmermans. However, I would like to make one remark because I think that the current situation shows the limits and weaknesses of the toolkit that we have to protect and promote democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights. I am glad that, in this House, we are jointly working on a mechanism that will monitor and evaluate all the Member States because I think that we should move beyond the situation in which there are accusations of countries being singled out, or of interventions being politically motivated. Personally, Mr Legutko, you have accused some people here of being politically motivated. You know, we are not in government, so we have absolutely no issue here and no interest. But I think it is very important that the European Union provides itself with a toolkit that will allow us to promote, protect and uphold democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights. That includes, in the part of the European Union where this fantastic people, the Polish people, live – and I would wholeheartedly endorse the actions by the Commission.","Mr President, I would like to say this to our colleague Mr Legutko: I think that eight minutes of filibustering, caricature and ridicule will probably get you a lot of airtime on Polish television, but you are not actually doing anything for the interests of the Polish people.

Tamás Deutsch,PPE," – Tisztelt Elnök úr! 2010-ben a magyarok szabad akaratukból elzavarták a korrupt, az országot a csőd szélére juttató és az emberek alapvető jogait lábbal tipró baloldalt, és úgy döntöttek, hogy kétharmados parlamenti többséggel ruházzák fel a Fideszt és a KDNP-t. A demokratikus döntés után azonnal elkezdődött a baloldal gyűlöletkeltése, az indulatos támadások sorozata, aminek az Európai Parlament Magyarországot hazugságok tucatjaival megvádoló Tavares-jelentése lett az összefoglalása. Már ebben a baloldali politikai plamfletben is benne volt az azóta folyamatosan hangoztatott összes hazugság és rágalom, kezdve az antiszemitizmus vérvádjával, a korrupcióval, a populizmus bélyegével, a sajtószabadság állítólagos halálán keresztül a jogállami intézmények ellen intézett támadásokról szóló hazugságokig. 2014 -ben, a baloldal támadásai közepette is, a magyarok szabad akaratukból ismét kétharmados többséggel támogatták a Fideszt.  A magyar és az európai baloldal a magyarok döntését már egyenesen provokációnak tekintette, és még vehemensebben gyalázta Magyarországot. Különösen 2015 után, amikor összeállt az EP bevándorláspárti többsége a bevándorlást elutasító Magyarországgal szemben. Ezeknek a méltatlan támadásoknak is megszületett az összefoglalása az Európai Parlamentben.

A baloldal pedig arra a következtetésre jutott, hogy a magyarok nem értenek az addigi fenyegetőzésekből, ezért eljött a módszeres és kíméletlen büntetés időszaka.

A demokratikus döntés után azonnal elkezdődött a baloldal gyűlöletkeltése, az indulatos támadások sorozata, aminek az Európai Parlament Magyarországot hazugságok tucatjaival megvádoló Tavares-jelentése lett az összefoglalása. Már ebben a baloldali politikai plamfletben is benne volt az azóta folyamatosan hangoztatott összes hazugság és rágalom, kezdve az antiszemitizmus vérvádjával, a korrupcióval, a populizmus bélyegével, a sajtószabadság állítólagos halálán keresztül a jogállami intézmények ellen intézett támadásokról szóló hazugságokig. 2014 -ben, a baloldal támadásai közepette is, a magyarok szabad akaratukból ismét kétharmados többséggel támogatták a Fideszt. A magyar és az európai baloldal a magyarok döntését már egyenesen provokációnak tekintette, és még vehemensebben gyalázta Magyarországot. Különösen 2015 után, amikor összeállt az EP bevándorláspárti többsége a bevándorlást elutasító Magyarországgal szemben. Ezeknek a méltatlan támadásoknak is megszületett az összefoglalása az Európai Parlamentben.

Paul Murphy ,GUE/NGL,"I voted in favour of this report as in a limited way it takes a step in the direction of tackling the current lack of transparency in relation to export credits and in tackling the massive gap between the stated objectives of the EU and the reality of how export credits are used in the EU.

Ευάγγελος Βενιζέλος,N/A,"Κύριε Πρόεδρε, Αξιότιμα Μέλη, επειδή έτυχε να ασκώ τα καθήκοντα του υπουργού οικονομικών στην Ελλάδα την πιο δύσκολη στιγμή της δημοσιονομικής κρίσης, όταν η δημοσιονομική κρίση μετατράπηκε σε κρίση του τραπεζικού συστήματος, λόγω και της ανάγκης δραστικής μείωσης του ελληνικού δημοσίου χρέους, μπορώ, χάρη στα βιώματα και την εμπειρία μου, να σας διαβεβαιώσω ότι αυτό που γίνεται σήμερα, αυτή η απόφαση που θα λάβετε για την τραπεζική ένωση και τον ενιαίο μηχανισμό εξυγίανσης, είναι μια πολύ σημαντική πράξη και, τολμώ να πω, μια ιστορική πράξη, διότι θα σπάσουμε τον δεσμό που υπάρχει και επιτρέπει το ενδεχόμενο η δημοσιονομική κρίση να μετατρέπεται σε χρηματοοικονομική και χρηματοπιστωτική και το αντίστροφο. Αυτό τον φαύλο κύκλο δεν πρέπει να τον ξαναζήσουμε. Η προσπάθεια να συμπληρωθούν τα θεμελιώδη και εκ γενετής κενά της Οικονομικής και Νομισματικής Ένωσης είναι δύσκολη. Η ολοκλήρωση της Οικονομικής και Νομισματικής Ένωσης απαιτεί πολλές προσπάθειες ακόμη. Συμφωνώ με τους αξιότιμους βουλευτές που τόνισαν προηγουμένως ότι δεν αρκεί να έχουμε έναν ενιαίο μηχανισμό εποπτείας και δεν αρκεί να έχουμε έναν ενιαίο μηχανισμό εξυγίανσης, με όσα προβλήματα και ατέλειες έχει, αλλά χρειαζόμαστε και έναν πραγματικά ενιαίο μηχανισμό προστασίας εγγυήσεων σε πανευρωπαϊκό επίπεδο που θα ξεπερνά τους στόχους της οδηγίας, που είναι στόχοι εναρμόνισης των εθνικών συστημάτων εγγύησης. Σε πολύ μεγάλο βαθμό, αυτό που συμβαίνει είναι μια προσπάθεια να αρθούν πολύ σημαντικές εσωτερικές ανισότητες μεταξύ των κρατών μελών και διαρθρωτικές ανισότητες της ενιαίας αγοράς στον χρηματοοικονομικό τομέα. Η πιο σημαντική, κατά τη γνώμη μου, ανισότητα στην ευρωπαϊκή τραπεζική αγορά είναι η ανισότητα των επιτοκίων, διότι αναπαράγει βαθιές αναπτυξιακές ανισότητες μεταξύ των κρατών μελών. Όταν μια ελληνική μικρή ή μεσαία επιχείρηση δανείζεται χρήμα από τις τράπεζες με επιτόκιο 6 ή 7 % ακριβότερο από το επιτόκιο με το οποίο δανείζεται μια γερμανική επιχείρηση, τότε αναπαράγεται μια εσωτερική αναπτυξιακή και κοινωνική ανισότητα. Αυτό οφείλεται σε πολύ μεγάλο βαθμό και στο γεγονός ότι δεν υπάρχει τραπεζική ένωση. Μια πολύ σημαντική ανισότητα που συνεχίζουμε να αντιμετωπίζουμε στην Ελλάδα και σε άλλες χώρες είναι η απόσυρση καταθέσεων για να μεταφερθούν σε άλλη χώρα, όχι γιατί υπάρχει καλύτερο επιτόκιο - μπορεί το επιτόκιο να είναι μικρότερο - αλλά γιατί υπάρχει βαθύτερο αίσθημα ασφάλειας· κάτι που έχει πολύ μεγάλη σημασία. Γι' αυτό χρειαζόμαστε και τον τρίτο πυλώνα του ευρωπαϊκού μηχανισμού εγγύησης καταθέσεων, προκειμένου να ξεπεραστούν οριστικά αυτές οι δύο πολύ σημαντικές ανισότητες. Τίθεται τώρα όμως ένα πολύ μεγάλο ερώτημα, λίγες μέρες πριν από τις ευρωπαϊκές εκλογές, τώρα που πρέπει όλοι να διατυπώσουμε την ολοκληρωμένη πρότασή μας για το μέλλον της ευρωπαϊκής ολοκλήρωσης καθώς απευθυνόμαστε σε πολίτες και δη νέους ευρωπαίους πολίτες που είναι άνεργοι. Το ερώτημα είναι γιατί να τους ενδιαφέρει αυτό που γίνεται στην τραπεζική ένωση και γιατί είναι σημαντικό για τους ίδιους να υπάρχει ενιαίος μηχανισμός εποπτείας και ενιαίος μηχανισμός εξυγίανσης καταθέσεων. Πρέπει να εξηγήσουμε στους πολίτες ότι αυτές είναι προκαταρκτικές προϋποθέσεις για να στηριχθεί, με πιο υγιή και ανταγωνιστικό τρόπο, η ευρωπαϊκή πραγματική οικονομία και για να ενισχυθούν οι ευρωπαϊκές επιχειρήσεις επί ίσοις όροις, με υγιή τρόπο, με επιτόκια τα οποία είναι πραγματικά ανταγωνιστικά. Έτσι θα επιδιώξουμε το μεγάλο ζητούμενο που είναι η ανάπτυξη και τελικά η δημιουργία θέσεων απασχόλησης. Έτσι θα χτυπήσουμε το πρόβλημα της ανεργίας και ιδίως την ανεργία των νέων στην καρδιά του. Το συμπέρασμα συνεπώς είναι ότι η τραπεζική ένωση δεν αφορά μόνο τράπεζες, τραπεζίτες, υβριδικά προϊόντα, μετόχους, χρηματοοικονομικά παιχνίδια, δεν περιορίζεται δηλαδή μόνο στην χρηματοοικονομική σφαίρα αλλά αφορά εν τέλει, και κυρίως, τη σφαίρα της πραγματικής οικονομίας, εκεί όπου πονά η Ευρώπη και εκεί που εκφράζεται η αγωνία του κάθε ευρωπαίου πολίτη και ιδίως εκείνου που ζει σε κατάσταση ανεργίας, ή, οριακά, σε κατάσταση φτώχειας. Έχει λοιπόν πολύ μεγάλη σημασία να μιλήσουμε για όλα όσα πρέπει να γίνουν. Συμφωνώ με τον Επίτροπο Barnier, τον οποίο και εγώ τιμώ και επαινώ για τη δουλειά του, την εμμονή του, τον σταθερό προσανατολισμό του, όταν δηλώνει ότι πρέπει να κάνουμε και άλλα βήματα. Σημειώνω, ως πολύ σημαντικό βήμα και ως στοιχείο διαφάνειας, τον απόλυτο διαχωρισμό επενδυτικών και εμπορικών τραπεζών. Έχει πάρα πολύ μεγάλη σημασία να πούμε ποια είναι η αλήθεια σε σχέση με τους στόχους μας στην τραπεζική ένωση. Προφανώς και θέλουμε να ελέγξουμε την ποιότητα των χαρτοφυλακίων των τραπεζών, και των επενδυτικών και των εμπορικών. Προφανώς και θέλουμε να ελέγξουμε τα κριτήρια και την ποιότητα των δανειοδοτήσεων από τις τράπεζες. Αυτοί οι έλεγχοι, μέσα από τον ενιαίο μηχανισμό εποπτείας, βοηθούν σε τελική ανάλυση στην ανάπτυξη, βοηθούν στην υγιή ανταγωνιστικότητα, βοηθούν στις επενδύσεις και βοηθούν, τέλος, στην αντιμετώπιση του μεγάλου προβλήματος που είναι η ανεργία. Υπάρχει η σκέψη ότι πίσω από όλα αυτά κρύβεται το γεγονός ότι η χρηματοοικονομική σφαίρα έχει οριστικά αποχωριστεί από την πραγματική οικονομία και αυτοτροφοδοτείται, ότι αποκομίζει εύκολα κέρδη μέσα από χρηματοοικονομικά παιχνίδια και ότι αυτή είναι μια ιστορία χωρίς τέλος, ότι μπορούμε δηλαδή έτσι να πορευόμαστε προς το μέλλον, χωρίς κανέναν κίνδυνο, σωρεύοντας υπερκέρδη. Αυτό δεν οδηγεί πουθενά. Απεδείχθη ότι δεν οδηγεί πουθενά. Πρέπει επίσης να πω και κάτι άλλο, ότι ο έλεγχος της ποιότητας των χαρτοφυλακίων των τραπεζών, των 130 ευρωπαϊκών συστημικών τραπεζών, τελικά οδηγεί και σε μία έμμεση αξιολόγηση των κρατικών ομολόγων και άρα μας φέρνει αντιμέτωπους και με το ζήτημα του ευρωπαϊκού δημοσίου χρέους, διότι φυσικά η διαχείριση του ευρωπαϊκού δημοσίου χρέους, του δημοσίου χρέους των κρατών μελών, δεν μπορεί να γίνει μόνον από τα κράτη ή την Ευρωπαϊκή Κεντρική Τράπεζα ή τον Ευρωπαίκό Μηχανισμό Σταθερότητας. Χρειαζόμαστε το ευρωπαϊκό τραπεζικό σύστημα αλλά χρειαζόμαστε εκείνο το ευρωπαϊκό τραπεζικό σύστημα που εξασφαλίζει, μέσα από τη συμμετοχή στην αγορά κρατικών ομολόγων στην Ευρώπη, την απόκτηση και τη διατήρηση ενός υγιούς χαρτοφυλακίου το οποίο, με τη σειρά του, θα βοηθήσει τις πραγματικές οικονομίες των κρατών μελών. Με τον τρόπο αυτό θα μπορέσουμε να περάσουμε από την εμπειρία του φαύλου κύκλου σε έναν κύκλο εξυγίανσης, ο οποίος είναι πάρα πολύ σημαντικός για την προοπτική της ευρωπαϊκής ολοκλήρωσης. Είναι λοιπόν πολύ σημαντικό να απευθυνθούμε στους ευρωπαίους πολίτες μιλώντας τους για πράγματα που τους αφορούν, εξηγώντας τους ότι αυτά που κάνουμε δεν είναι αφηρημένες έννοιες και δεν αφορούν ένα κλειστό κόσμο των χρηματοοικονομικών συναλλαγών αλλά αφορούν την πραγματική Ευρώπη, τις ευρωπαϊκές κοινωνίες, τους λαούς και τους πολίτες.

Σε πολύ μεγάλο βαθμό, αυτό που συμβαίνει είναι μια προσπάθεια να αρθούν πολύ σημαντικές εσωτερικές ανισότητες μεταξύ των κρατών μελών και διαρθρωτικές ανισότητες της ενιαίας αγοράς στον χρηματοοικονομικό τομέα. Η πιο σημαντική, κατά τη γνώμη μου, ανισότητα στην ευρωπαϊκή τραπεζική αγορά είναι η ανισότητα των επιτοκίων, διότι αναπαράγει βαθιές αναπτυξιακές ανισότητες μεταξύ των κρατών μελών. Όταν μια ελληνική μικρή ή μεσαία επιχείρηση δανείζεται χρήμα από τις τράπεζες με επιτόκιο 6 ή 7 % ακριβότερο από το επιτόκιο με το οποίο δανείζεται μια γερμανική επιχείρηση, τότε αναπαράγεται μια εσωτερική αναπτυξιακή και κοινωνική ανισότητα. Αυτό οφείλεται σε πολύ μεγάλο βαθμό και στο γεγονός ότι δεν υπάρχει τραπεζική ένωση. Μια πολύ σημαντική ανισότητα που συνεχίζουμε να αντιμετωπίζουμε στην Ελλάδα και σε άλλες χώρες είναι η απόσυρση καταθέσεων για να μεταφερθούν σε άλλη χώρα, όχι γιατί υπάρχει καλύτερο επιτόκιο - μπορεί το επιτόκιο να είναι μικρότερο - αλλά γιατί υπάρχει βαθύτερο αίσθημα ασφάλειας· κάτι που έχει πολύ μεγάλη σημασία. Γι' αυτό χρειαζόμαστε και τον τρίτο πυλώνα του ευρωπαϊκού μηχανισμού εγγύησης καταθέσεων, προκειμένου να ξεπεραστούν οριστικά αυτές οι δύο πολύ σημαντικές ανισότητες. Τίθεται τώρα όμως ένα πολύ μεγάλο ερώτημα, λίγες μέρες πριν από τις ευρωπαϊκές εκλογές, τώρα που πρέπει όλοι να διατυπώσουμε την ολοκληρωμένη πρότασή μας για το μέλλον της ευρωπαϊκής ολοκλήρωσης καθώς απευθυνόμαστε σε πολίτες και δη νέους ευρωπαίους πολίτες που είναι άνεργοι. Το ερώτημα είναι γιατί να τους ενδιαφέρει αυτό που γίνεται στην τραπεζική ένωση και γιατί είναι σημαντικό για τους ίδιους να υπάρχει ενιαίος μηχανισμός εποπτείας και ενιαίος μηχανισμός εξυγίανσης καταθέσεων. Πρέπει να εξηγήσουμε στους πολίτες ότι αυτές είναι προκαταρκτικές προϋποθέσεις για να στηριχθεί, με πιο υγιή και ανταγωνιστικό τρόπο, η ευρωπαϊκή πραγματική οικονομία και για να ενισχυθούν οι ευρωπαϊκές επιχειρήσεις επί ίσοις όροις, με υγιή τρόπο, με επιτόκια τα οποία είναι πραγματικά ανταγωνιστικά. Έτσι θα επιδιώξουμε το μεγάλο ζητούμενο που είναι η ανάπτυξη και τελικά η δημιουργία θέσεων απασχόλησης. Έτσι θα χτυπήσουμε το πρόβλημα της ανεργίας και ιδίως την ανεργία των νέων στην καρδιά του. Το συμπέρασμα συνεπώς είναι ότι η τραπεζική ένωση δεν αφορά μόνο τράπεζες, τραπεζίτες, υβριδικά προϊόντα, μετόχους, χρηματοοικονομικά παιχνίδια, δεν περιορίζεται δηλαδή μόνο στην χρηματοοικονομική σφαίρα αλλά αφορά εν τέλει, και κυρίως, τη σφαίρα της πραγματικής οικονομίας, εκεί όπου πονά η Ευρώπη και εκεί που εκφράζεται η αγωνία του κάθε ευρωπαίου πολίτη και ιδίως εκείνου που ζει σε κατάσταση ανεργίας, ή, οριακά, σε κατάσταση φτώχειας. Έχει λοιπόν πολύ μεγάλη σημασία να μιλήσουμε για όλα όσα πρέπει να γίνουν. Συμφωνώ με τον Επίτροπο Barnier, τον οποίο και εγώ τιμώ και επαινώ για τη δουλειά του, την εμμονή του, τον σταθερό προσανατολισμό του, όταν δηλώνει ότι πρέπει να κάνουμε και άλλα βήματα. Σημειώνω, ως πολύ σημαντικό βήμα και ως στοιχείο διαφάνειας, τον απόλυτο διαχωρισμό επενδυτικών και εμπορικών τραπεζών. Έχει πάρα πολύ μεγάλη σημασία να πούμε ποια είναι η αλήθεια σε σχέση με τους στόχους μας στην τραπεζική ένωση. Προφανώς και θέλουμε να ελέγξουμε την ποιότητα των χαρτοφυλακίων των τραπεζών, και των επενδυτικών και των εμπορικών. Προφανώς και θέλουμε να ελέγξουμε τα κριτήρια και την ποιότητα των δανειοδοτήσεων από τις τράπεζες. Αυτοί οι έλεγχοι, μέσα από τον ενιαίο μηχανισμό εποπτείας, βοηθούν σε τελική ανάλυση στην ανάπτυξη, βοηθούν στην υγιή ανταγωνιστικότητα, βοηθούν στις επενδύσεις και βοηθούν, τέλος, στην αντιμετώπιση του μεγάλου προβλήματος που είναι η ανεργία. Υπάρχει η σκέψη ότι πίσω από όλα αυτά κρύβεται το γεγονός ότι η χρηματοοικονομική σφαίρα έχει οριστικά αποχωριστεί από την πραγματική οικονομία και αυτοτροφοδοτείται, ότι αποκομίζει εύκολα κέρδη μέσα από χρηματοοικονομικά παιχνίδια και ότι αυτή είναι μια ιστορία χωρίς τέλος, ότι μπορούμε δηλαδή έτσι να πορευόμαστε προς το μέλλον, χωρίς κανέναν κίνδυνο, σωρεύοντας υπερκέρδη. Αυτό δεν οδηγεί πουθενά. Απεδείχθη ότι δεν οδηγεί πουθενά. Πρέπει επίσης να πω και κάτι άλλο, ότι ο έλεγχος της ποιότητας των χαρτοφυλακίων των τραπεζών, των 130 ευρωπαϊκών συστημικών τραπεζών, τελικά οδηγεί και σε μία έμμεση αξιολόγηση των κρατικών ομολόγων και άρα μας φέρνει αντιμέτωπους και με το ζήτημα του ευρωπαϊκού δημοσίου χρέους, διότι φυσικά η διαχείριση του ευρωπαϊκού δημοσίου χρέους, του δημοσίου χρέους των κρατών μελών, δεν μπορεί να γίνει μόνον από τα κράτη ή την Ευρωπαϊκή Κεντρική Τράπεζα ή τον Ευρωπαίκό Μηχανισμό Σταθερότητας. Χρειαζόμαστε το ευρωπαϊκό τραπεζικό σύστημα αλλά χρειαζόμαστε εκείνο το ευρωπαϊκό τραπεζικό σύστημα που εξασφαλίζει, μέσα από τη συμμετοχή στην αγορά κρατικών ομολόγων στην Ευρώπη, την απόκτηση και τη διατήρηση ενός υγιούς χαρτοφυλακίου το οποίο, με τη σειρά του, θα βοηθήσει τις πραγματικές οικονομίες των κρατών μελών. Με τον τρόπο αυτό θα μπορέσουμε να περάσουμε από την εμπειρία του φαύλου κύκλου σε έναν κύκλο εξυγίανσης, ο οποίος είναι πάρα πολύ σημαντικός για την προοπτική της ευρωπαϊκής ολοκλήρωσης. Είναι λοιπόν πολύ σημαντικό να απευθυνθούμε στους ευρωπαίους πολίτες μιλώντας τους για πράγματα που τους αφορούν, εξηγώντας τους ότι αυτά που κάνουμε δεν είναι αφηρημένες έννοιες και δεν αφορούν ένα κλειστό κόσμο των χρηματοοικονομικών συναλλαγών αλλά αφορούν την πραγματική Ευρώπη, τις ευρωπαϊκές κοινωνίες, τους λαούς και τους πολίτες. Σας ευχαριστώ πολύ","Κύριε Πρόεδρε, Αξιότιμα Μέλη, επειδή έτυχε να ασκώ τα καθήκοντα του υπουργού οικονομικών στην Ελλάδα την πιο δύσκολη στιγμή της δημοσιονομικής κρίσης, όταν η δημοσιονομική κρίση μετατράπηκε σε κρίση του τραπεζικού συστήματος, λόγω και της ανάγκης δραστικής μείωσης του ελληνικού δημοσίου χρέους, μπορώ, χάρη στα βιώματα και την εμπειρία μου, να σας διαβεβαιώσω ότι αυτό που γίνεται σήμερα, αυτή η απόφαση που θα λάβετε για την τραπεζική ένωση και τον ενιαίο μηχανισμό εξυγίανσης, είναι μια πολύ σημαν",Economy
Konrad Szymański ,ECR," Mr President, the report proposes a significant tightening up of the European Union’s climate policy by, on the one hand, increasing reduction targets by up to 80% by 2050 and, on the other, by reducing the number of permits available on the market by letting them expire them before the third phase of the ETS. We cannot agree to this for both economic and political reasons. In Durban we all agreed that international negotiations would continue until 2015. There is no reason why the European Union should be making its climate policy more restrictive at this time without international agreement. This road leads directly to loss of competitiveness. In Poland, the stricter climate policy would incur an annual cost of EUR 5.4 billion, which is more than half of all business profits, or all of industry pre-tax profits and, for this reason, the legislative proposal in this regard, even without the Council’s decision, would be a mark of extreme disloyalty not just to Central Europe, but also to European industry.","Mr President, the report proposes a significant tightening up of the European Union’s climate policy by, on the one hand, increasing reduction targets by up to 80% by 2050 and, on the other, by reducing the number of permits available on the market by letting them expire them before the third phase of the ETS.

Als we nu gewoon maar kijken naar het feit dat Israël sinds 2017 jaarlijks 12 000 woningen bijbouwt op de Westelijke Jordaanoever, dat er 26 illegale buitenposten zijn bijgebouwd, en dat er sinds 2009 niet minder dan 6 000 Palestijnse gebouwen op de Westelijke Jordaanoever zijn vernietigd, inclusief gebouwen gefinancierd met Europees belastinggeld, dan denk ik dat het toch duidelijk moet zijn. Israël werkt stap voor stap aan een éénstaatrealiteit, aan een fragmentatie van het Palestijnse grondgebied waar straks helemaal geen plaats meer is voor de Palestijnen.

Stella Kyriakides,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Thank you, President, but I think the praise should be extended to almost everyone in this European Parliament for the work that we have been doing together for the last 18 months. I began by underlining the need for bold action, and I very much welcome hearing all your interventions today. It’s clear that you share our level of ambition and the need for quick and decisive action. The health union will have to ensure, as many of you have said, that we need a strong common response, but recognising specific needs and contexts. When protecting our citizens, we need to be one step ahead; we cannot be running behind and trying to catch up. The progress made so far in Parliament on these proposals is definitely taking us in the right direction, but we need to move faster towards adoption. The number of citizens that we have lost to this virus in the past year is a wake-up call to us all. The Council has already made considerable progress and adopted its general approach on 23 July. Now we start the interinstitutional negotiations, and let me assure you that the Commission will play its part in reaching quick and meaningful agreement. I heard some colleagues speak about the need to have more work done on therapeutics. We have been working on an EU therapeutic strategy for the last few months, and I am in a position to tell you that we have launched this strategy and are expecting the European Medicines Agency’s assessment of three new therapeutics in October. So we are leaving no stone unturned. But on the other hand, I have also heard many raise the subject of national competences – a taboo subject in the area of health. What we seem to forget is that the world after COVID-19 is fundamentally different. We cannot treat public health matters as we did before. We need a strong EU legal framework. We need to be able to act at EU level while respecting Member States’ competences. A strong European Health Union is not about, as I have heard, using the COVID-19 crisis to grab power. It is about using this crisis to turn it into positive action. It is using this crisis to bring about positive change for EU citizens, all within the Treaty framework. So let’s all work together. Let’s press ahead with these ambitious and much-needed proposals so we can adopt them at the end of this year. This is what this European Union needs. This is what our citizens expect from us and we should not deliver anything less.","Member of the Commission. – Thank you, President, but I think the praise should be extended to almost everyone in this European Parliament for the work that we have been doing together for the last 18 months.

Gunnar Beck,ID," – Herr Präsident! Die ID-Stiftung hat kürzlich den Einfluss von NGOs auf die EU-Gesetzgebung untersucht. Von 12 600 Lobbyisten im EU‑Transparenzregister sind 3 500 NGOs. NGOs pflegen enge Kontakte zu Kommission und Politikern und schreiben hier Gesetzentwürfe wie Lobbyisten, unterliegen aber kaum Offenlegungsregeln. Von 2014 bis 2017 erhielten NGOs mindestens 11,3 Milliarden Euro aus dem EU-Haushalt. Das sind mindestens 11,3 Milliarden für Pro‑EU‑Lobbyarbeit, denn NGOs fordern mehr Migration, mehr Klimarettung, Minderheitenrechte und mehr EU. „NGO“ oder „Organisation ohne Erwerbszweck“ klingt wohl philanthropisch und wie „gemeinnützige Vereinigung“. Doch multinationale NGOs erhalten Milliarden von Finanzinvestoren und sind finanzstärker als mittlere Sparkassen. Doch als sogenannte not obliged entities oder privilegierte Organisationen sind sie von Antigeldwäsche- und Finanztransparenzgesetzen ausgenommen. Ihre Geldquellen bleiben vielfach im Dunkeln.

Billy Kelleher,ALDE," – Mr President, on this report, there’s no doubt we need to ensure there is strong collaboration across the European Union in the area of metrology itself. We have to ensure that, when we are involved in this, that we use the best scientific evidence available to us and that can only be brought about if we quantify it and measure it and have the proper statistics available for us, in terms of policymakers, in terms of government, in terms of industry, to ensure that when they are making decisions, there are basing them on the most up-to-date, scientific evidence available through proper measurement.  We also have to accept that we’re in a changing period – global warming, climate change, medical devices, medicines, atomic research, atomic science – that there are key significant areas that are taking us into areas of the unknown. And in going there, we have to ensure that we have the best evidence available to us in terms of quantifying and measurement.  So, from that perspective, I think the European Partnership on Metrology is very welcome, and I think it will be significant not only for research and innovation, but also filtering out into the broader education curriculum right across the European Union.  So I very much welcome this report and I hope that we can get on with implementing its recommendations.","– Mr President, on this report, there’s no doubt we need to ensure there is strong collaboration across the European Union in the area of metrology itself. We have to ensure that, when we are involved in this, that we use the best scientific evidence available to us and that can only be brought about if we quantify it and measure it and have the proper statistics available for us, in terms of policymakers, in terms of government, in terms of industry, to ensure that when they are making decisions, there are basing them on the most up-to-date, scientific evidence available through proper measurement. We also have to accept that we’re in a changing period – global warming, climate change, medical devices, medicines, atomic research, atomic science – that there are key significant areas that are taking us into areas of the unknown. And in going there, we have to ensure that we have the best evidence available to us in terms of quantifying and measurement.

Vilija Blinkevičiūtė ,S&D," I voted in favour of this report on Draft amending budget No 5/2012 of the European Union for the financial year 2012 (which the Commission submitted on 19 September 2012). I believe that it is very important to release financial assistance through the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) for those affected by natural disasters as soon as possible. It is important to point out that Draft amending budget No 5/2012 relates to the mobilisation of the EUSF for an amount of EUR 670 192 359 in commitment and payment appropriations relating to the series of earthquakes in Emilia-Romagna, Italy in May 2012. This financial assistance will help the Member State to deal with an important and urgent matter.","I voted in favour of this report on Draft amending budget No 5/2012 of the European Union for the financial year 2012 .

Alfredo Antoniozzi ,PPE," Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, around half of all CO2 emission-intensive industrial projects in developing countries have some form of export credit agency support. These projects usually present a high environmental and social risk. Moreover, it is difficult, if not impossible, to assess the scale of this phenomenon, since the agencies themselves have no data or rules on transparency of information. This situation is completely at odds with our environmental policy. I wonder whether it would not be worth looking at the scale of this phenomenon in more depth. Mandatory risk calculations are a first step. However, even clearer rules are needed in order to direct these forms of financial support towards the carbon reduction target that we have set ourselves.","Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, around half of all CO2 emission-intensive industrial projects in developing countries have some form of export credit agency support.

Diogo Feio ,PPE," Despite voting in line with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I must express some concerns I have about the present motion for a resolution. Firstly, I believe that smoke-free policies should be decided by the Member States and that the role of the European institutions, while respecting the subsidiarity principle, must remain at the level of non-binding recommendations. On the other hand, I also believe that Member States should promote smoke-free policies, but that they should not impose any restrictions on freedom of choice for operators, particularly in the hotel sector, where owners should have the option of being smoke-free or not. Against this backdrop, the act that was recently passed in Portugal was a well balanced one. My second concern is with the proposed end of direct subsidies linked to tobacco production. As Portugal is also a tobacco producer, I think that this type of policy needs to be extremely carefully analysed; otherwise it could be severely detrimental to farmers who find themselves unable to continue production without being given a viable alternative. This is my opinion on item 9 of this resolution.","Despite voting in line with the Group of the European People’s Party , I must express some concerns I have about the present motion for a resolution.

Marielle De Sarnez  ,ALDE," Madam President, Commissioner, as my fellow Members have already pointed out, hot on the heels of the Year for Combating Poverty, and as the number of poor in Europe continues to grow, the European aid scheme for our most deprived citizens – a vital part of food aid in Europe – is now directly in the line of fire. The amount of aid is going to be cut by 80% in 2012 and there are no guarantees at all for 2013. Therefore, you urgently need to come up with a practical solution for the millions of beneficiaries. For starters, the Commission needs to establish a transitional solution forthwith that will guarantee the programme’s existence for the next two years and maintain the food aid currently provided to our most deprived citizens. Looking ahead, you need to understand that Parliament demands, expects and hopes that the Commission will establish a permanent facility dedicated to ensuring sustainable European food security with an annual budget of around EUR 500 million – although that figure will have to allow for changes in food prices. To do that, you will need to mobilise the requisite budgetary resources. That is what we in this House expect from you. In the long term, we need to agree to restrict speculation on commodities so as to create more control over food prices. Obviously, European farmers of the future will need to be able to make a living from what they produce. Consumers should no longer have to live with constant price rises, and our most deprived citizens must have enough to eat. European solidarity is needed more than ever before. It is therefore our duty and your duty to make this aid permanent, given that millions of individuals depend on it. It is incumbent upon us and upon you to combat poverty and exclusion in Europe.","Madam President, Commissioner, as my fellow Members have already pointed out, hot on the heels of the Year for Combating Poverty, and as the number of poor in Europe continues to grow, the European aid scheme for our most deprived citizens – a vital part of food aid in Europe – is now directly in the line of fire.

Marian Harkin,ALDE,"Mr President, I fully support the derogation to 2013 whereby the numbers would decrease from 1 000 to 500. It is very clear, if you look at the applications coming in from Member States, that more and more Member States are using this basis, Article 2b. If we look even at the applications in 2009 and 2010, we can see that this is the situation and I, like Madam Berès, will call on the Council to support this. I believe Parliament will fully support this today and the Council should be here today to listen to the strong views of the Parliament on this. In 2010, 10% of all redundant workers accessed funding under the EGF.

Central to that, of course, are measures that improve their employability opportunities but there are other benefits, too, and I agree with you, Commissioner; it is an expression of solidarity, but the good thing is that that solidarity is very closely linked to the EU 2020 objectives. So we have a win-win situation where we have a connection to citizens that helps to ensure the EU 2020 objectives are achieved.

Olivér Várhelyi,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I thank the European Parliament for adding this very important issue to the agenda of the plenary immediately after the adoption of the Commission proposal on the revised enlargement methodology. This is a good opportunity here to present our idea, how to enhance the accession process and how to give a credible EU perspective for the Western Balkans. Let me emphasise that for our geopolitical Commission, the full engagement with our neighbours is a top priority. Europe needs to have a strong united voice in the world and it needs to play its geopolitical role to the fore, especially when it comes to its neighbourhood. This is especially valid where we must engage strongly in pursuit of peace, stability and prosperity. This is in our own interest. It is also a question of credibility. The priority of this Commission is to accelerate progress in the Western Balkans, keeping a credible perspective for future accession. Therefore, we are working on three tracks. The first of these is the communication on the revised enlargement methodology, which I will outline for you in more detail shortly. The second track is opening discussion negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania, before the Western Balkans summit in Zagreb. Ahead of the Zagreb Summit, we will complete the picture with the third track by presenting a major economic and investment development plan for the region. The objective will be to speed up the building of a solid and resilient economy and bring these countries faster and closer to our own standards. When it comes to the first track, the revised enlargement methodology is based on four main principles, four principles that should work both for the accession countries and also for our own Member States. First, the process has to be more credible. Countries need to deliver on the reforms they promised, and the EU needs to deliver when they do so. To help credibility, you will see an ever-stronger focus on the fundamental freedoms and reforms, as this is the core for real transformation. This means the rule of law, but also functioning of democratic institutions, public administration reform and economic criteria. The second principle is about putting the political nature of the process front and centre. We intend to ensure top-level engagement with the candidate countries through regular EU-Western Balkans summits and ministerial meetings. We want to involve Member States more strongly and give them better opportunities to monitor and review the process, to support and keep track of the fundamental reforms needed. The third principle addresses the need to make the whole process more dynamic, with a stronger focus on core sectors. Clustering chapters by policy fields will allow for more thorough political discussions on thematic areas. It will also allow us to identify opportunities for early alignment and involvement in EU policies, such as our digital agenda or our trans-European networks in transport and energy. I also want to highlight that when important reforms have been implemented already before the opening, then the timeframe between opening the cluster and closing individual chapters should be limited, preferably within a year, fully dependent on the progress of the reforms. This is an important political offer from our side to the whole region. If they deliver, we will also be ready to deliver. The cluster on fundamentals, rule of law, economic criteria and public administration reform will of course take a central role. It will be the first chapter to be opened and it will be the last to be closed. And sufficient progress will be needed in these areas before other clusters can be closed. The fourth principle is about making the process more predictable for both sides. This will mean ensuring that candidate countries have greater clarity on the conditions they need to meet and what is the positive impact when there is progress, and what are the negative consequences in case of non-delivery. We need clear and tangible incentives to encourage reforms. If countries move on agreed reform priorities sufficiently, citizens should see the benefits of accelerated integration and phasing into EU policies, markets and programmes, combined with increased funding and investments. At the same time, Member States need to be confident that there is reversibility and corrective measures will be taken where reforms go off track. This will be done through more decisive measures, sanctioning and serious or prolonged stagnation or backsliding. Finally, I have to reiterate that while we are strengthening and improving the process, the goal remains the same: accession and full EU membership. In parallel to this, as the second strand, the Commission stands by the recommendations to open accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania, and we hope that these can be opened before the Western Balkans summit in Zagreb. Both countries have delivered on what they were asked. During my recent visit to Skopje and Tirana I underlined the importance of reforms and called for their implementation to continue. Both countries have engaged in further reform efforts. At the same time, to be a credible partner, the EU needs to deliver on its promises as well. The Commission will give detailed information on the progress made by these two countries still in February, in order to prepare the ground for the Council for the decision. We are convinced that any further postponement would entail a strong risk, undermining the stability of the entire region. We would also risk further manipulation by third country actors and others offering false alternative narratives. Finally, on the third track, these substantially transformative reforms that the Western Balkan countries need to carry out can be best supported by solid and accelerated economic growth and developing functioning market economies. Therefore, as input to the Zagreb Summit, the Commission would propose a new economic-based policy approach as the cornerstone of a forward-looking agenda for the region. Our objective is to intensify our presence in the Western Balkans, to increase investment and to help to close the economic development gap between us. We have to look at what concrete measures we can take to bring forward investments in the Western Balkans, to enhance access to the EU single market, create jobs and entrepreneur opportunities, improve the business and the investment climate and stop the brain drain from the region. As you can see, this is an ambitious agenda for the region. We will need the very strong political support of this House to deliver it. We collectively have to regain trust and credibility. This means we have to treat our Western Balkans partners more and more as future Member States, which is our commonly agreed destiny. This is for the benefit of the European Union as a whole.","Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I thank the European Parliament for adding this very important issue to the agenda of the plenary immediately after the adoption of the Commission proposal on the revised enlargement methodology.

Angelo Ciocca,ID," – Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, dalla sede di Milano raccontiamo quello che la Lega racconta da anni e ci fa piacere che finalmente il Parlamento europeo parla di dazi e capisce l'importanza dei dazi. I dazi sono uno strumento per regolare i mercati laddove c'è una concorrenza sleale. Se ci sono paesi che hanno regole diverse rispetto ai nostri produttori, il dazio diventa uno strumento per evitare il cosiddetto dumping, per evitare la concorrenza sleale. L'Europa questo lo deve fare. Oltre a far questo deve anche mantenere i controlli sui prodotti che arrivano da fuori Europa, perché è la stessa Autorità europea per la sicurezza alimentare che certifica che i prodotti che arrivano in Europa sono otto volte più pericolosi rispetto a quelli italiani e a quelli europei, soprattutto quelli che arrivano dalla Cina e soprattutto quelli alimentari della Cina che, spesso, hanno dentro insetticidi vietati da anni dalle nostre leggi.

Jens Geier,S&D," Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, it is of course also appropriate at this point for we shadow rapporteurs to express our thanks and appreciation to the two rapporteurs from this House. They delved so deeply into the subject that sometimes we could no longer see them. My compliments on this splendid work. In connection with the Financial Regulation, we are also discussing Article 56, which deals with shared management. In the European Union, that is particularly important in regional policy and represents the second largest budget area. It represents the acid test for whether the Member States really are serious about the prudent use of EU funds, about which we have heard so much in the budget debates this morning. We see that, since 1994, there has been a total of more than EUR 7 billion in financial corrections in this area. We also see that, in 2010 alone, there was more than EUR 250 million in repayments to the EU budget – funds that were misspent in the Member States. At this point, I would like once again to recall the fact that EUR 250 million is more than the European Parliament wants to mobilise by means of the Flexibility Instrument. All I can say, Mr Dominik, is that when you next visit in the Council, please convey a message from the Committee on Budgets: we want our money back! What has been proposed in terms of audits and better control procedures in the Financial Regulation within the framework of Article 56 will help in this regard. I will be interested to see how the Council responds to this.","Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, it is of course also appropriate at this point for we shadow rapporteurs to express our thanks and appreciation to the two rapporteurs from this House.

Helena Dalli,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable members, fighting sexualised violence and the importance of the Istanbul Convention and the comprehensive proposal for a directive against gender-based violence is what we are discussing today. The scale of sexualised violence and violence against women in Europe is very high. One in three women in the European Union has experienced physical and or sexual violence, and one in twenty women has been raped. Reports and personal accounts indicate that rape and sexualised violence are being used as weapons of war in Ukraine. About one in five Europeans hold victim—blaming views, claiming that women make up or exaggerate claims and that violence against women is often provoked by the victim. We cannot, of course, tolerate this and must take a stance and end victim—blaming and rape culture. Excusing aggressive behaviour and shaming those who speak out about their experience has desensitised society to the horrors of rape and sexual assault. In the EU, 27% of people think that sexual intercourse without consent could be justified under certain circumstances, such as when the victim is drunk or when the victim does not clearly say no, or when the victim does not physically fight back. But these can never be considered as consent. This is why the Commission put forward a legislative proposal on combating violence against women and domestic violence. The proposal contains a host of measures to ensure that we protect victims from sexualised violence and prevent it from happening in the first place. It also proposes the introduction of a harmonised definition of rape based on the lack of consent. Only a yes is yes. Immediate specialised support is particularly important in cases of sexualised violence. The proposal would ensure that victims have immediate access to rape, crisis or sexual violence centres. Victims of sexualised violence are often confronted with insensitive or gender—stereotypical treatment during law enforcement proceedings. This can have serious consequences in terms of secondary victimisation and ultimately denies these victims the right to justice. Training sessions for law enforcement officials and judges are therefore of the utmost importance. The Commission’s proposal further seeks to prohibit judges from asking unnecessary and possibly traumatising questions about the victim’s sexual history. The proposal further seeks to prevent gender-based violence, including sexualised violence, by ensuring that awareness—raising campaigns aim to dispel harmful gender stereotypes. The measures I just mentioned are only a selection of those included in this comprehensive proposal, which covers the criminalisation of certain offences amounting to violence against women, the protection, support and access to justice for victims of violence against women and domestic violence, and the prevention of such forms of violence. Parliament’s full support is needed as a co-legislator to make sure we now introduce harmonised and comprehensive provisions and take a united stand against gender-based violence. The proposal is modelled on the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention, which has proven to be a comprehensive legal instrument to prevent and combat gender-based and domestic violence and protect the victims. So I stress here again, as already stated in the Commission’s gender equality strategy, that we remain committed to the EU’s accession to the Istanbul Convention. The Istanbul Convention is our international standard and engagement to which the EU wants to live up, just as we do to other international texts, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. We are counting on the Council to make sure that the EU now finalises accession to the convention, following the EU’s signature in 2017.","Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable members, fighting sexualised violence and the importance of the Istanbul Convention and the comprehensive proposal for a directive against gender-based violence is what we are discussing today.

Mathieu Grosch ,PPE," Demographic change towards an increasingly older society in conjunction with the setbacks in the areas of economic growth, state finances and the financial markets caused by the economic and financial crisis make it necessary to adapt our practices with regard to pensions. This adaptation is in keeping with the completion of the European internal market and the Europe 2020 goals for employment and the long-term sustainability of public finances. However, I welcome this proposal above all because it provides for more efficient pension provision that is to be both sustainable and safe. I am firmly convinced that pension provision should not only enable older EU citizens to live in dignity, but it should also be a reward for their working life as a whole. If we want the European citizens of tomorrow to be motivated in their work and to be open to cross-border activities, it is important, even today, to offer them the prospect of adequate and sustainable retirement pension provision, harmonised at European level. Nonetheless, the responsibility for pension provision remains with the Member States, meaning that pension systems primarily fall within the competence of the Member States and therefore the only thing that should be provided by Europe is coordinated guidance for Member States. In this regard, the principle of solidarity between the generations and that of national solidarity ought to be taken into consideration in particular. In addition, with regard to subsidiarity, all pension systems should remain ‘exportable’ for citizens.","Demographic change towards an increasingly older society in conjunction with the setbacks in the areas of economic growth, state finances and the financial markets caused by the economic and financial crisis make it necessary to adapt our practices with regard to pensions.

Luís Paulo Alves ,S&D," I am voting for this report, since I consider it essential to balance trade relations between two of the largest trading blocs in the world: the EU and China. The Chinese authorities have affirmed the need for growth based on increased living standards and the corresponding increase in domestic consumption, which may represent great economic opportunities for the EU. However, we cannot ignore the fact that the main reason for this imbalance is that European business cannot currently invest in China under the same conditions that Chinese investors enjoy in Europe. Moreover, it is worth noting that trade barriers still hinder access to Chinese markets, that there is a lack of equality in relation to public procurement, that there is a lack of intellectual property protection which deters European investors specialising in new technologies, and that the Chinese authorities impose restrictions on the country’s raw materials. In view of this, I will support greater economic cooperation between the EU and China only on condition that European businesses can operate under the same conditions in the Chinese market that Chinese investors enjoy in Europe. Otherwise, we will only exacerbate existing imbalances between these two economic blocs.","I am voting for this report, since I consider it essential to balance trade relations between two of the largest trading blocs in the world: the EU and China.

Yana Toom,N/A,"rapporteur. – Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner, all the colleagues and of course all the shadow rapporteurs. I apologise that I didn’t thank you in the very beginning, I did have a feeling that we are approaching the end. But in my closing remarks, I unfortunately have to address the letter sent this evening by a group of MEPs regarding tomorrow’s vote, in particular with a concern that we are aiming to give stateless people and long-term residents the same rights as EU citizens. Let me underline on the European level, not intervening into citizenship policy of Member States.  This para says, for instance, that stateless people in the EU are not protected from discrimination under EU acquis and are not covered by the visa code. The authors of the letters are not concerned by that. Their concern is Putin, to whom, in their view, adoption of the report will give a platform to attack Estonia and Latvia.  Firstly, this is a problem not only in my home country and neighbouring Latvia, this is also a problem, for instance, of Roma people in many different Member States. Secondly, I believe that bringing Putin into this discussion is absolutely unacceptable and shows very poor understanding of the problem.  We are speaking about Europeans, we are speaking about people who are living in Europe for decades, we are speaking about taxpayers. The number of petitions received by our committee on this issue, number of signatures collected in different Member States to support minorities clearly shows that these people rely on Europe.

I apologise that I didn’t thank you in the very beginning, I did have a feeling that we are approaching the end. But in my closing remarks, I unfortunately have to address the letter sent this evening by a group of MEPs regarding tomorrow’s vote, in particular with a concern that we are aiming to give stateless people and long-term residents the same rights as EU citizens. Let me underline on the European level, not intervening into citizenship policy of Member States. This para says, for instance, that stateless people in the EU are not protected from discrimination under EU acquis and are not covered by the visa code. The authors of the letters are not concerned by that. Their concern is Putin, to whom, in their view, adoption of the report will give a platform to attack Estonia and Latvia.

Birgit Sippel,S&D,"im Namen der S&D-Fraktion. – Herr Präsident! Schwarze Tage für freie Medien in Europa. In Polen schalteten am 10. Februar mehrere Medien aus Protest gegen eine neue Reklamesteuer schwarze Anzeigen. Offiziell zielt die Steuer auf Internetriesen wie Google, doch tatsächlich will die PiS regierungskritische Medien mundtot machen. Bereits im Dezember hatte sie sich mit dem Ankauf der Zeitungsgruppe Polska Press durch einen staatlich kontrollierten Ölkonzern indirekt Zugriff auf zwei Dutzend regionale Medien verschafft. Am 14. Februar konnte man Klubrádió zum letzten Mal analog einschalten, denn die Lizenzen wurden nicht verlängert. Seither ist der letzte landesweit bekannte unabhängige Rundfunksender Ungarns nur online abrufbar und erreicht damit nur noch einen Bruchteil seiner vorherigen Hörerschaft. In Slowenien gab es wiederholt verbale Attacken von Premier Janša gegen eine Journalistin und gleichzeitig spitzt sich die Situation um die slowenische Presseagentur zu. Die Regierung hatte die Finanzierung erneut ausgesetzt.  Medienfreiheit und Medienvielfalt sind unerlässliche Pfeiler der Demokratie. Aber es reicht nicht, ihre Lage in jährlichen Berichten zu analysieren, ihre Bedeutung in schönen Worten zu betonen und Ermahnungen zu äußern.

Die Umweltagentur der Europäischen Union hat es gestern wieder mal belegt: Die Natur in Europa ist bedroht, und die biologische Vielfalt geht weiter drastisch zurück. Zusammen mit der Veränderung des Klimas ist das ein gefährlicher Mix für die Zukunft, und da müssen wir Abgeordneten in jedem Bereich, in dem wir Verantwortung tragen, Maßnahmen ergreifen, um hier massiv entgegenzusteuern. Auch und vor allem in der Landwirtschaft. Wir treffen diese Woche Entscheidungen, in welche Richtung die Gemeinsame Agrarpolitik in Zukunft geht. Der Green Deal, die Biodiversitätsstrategie oder die Ziele der Farm-to-Fork-Strategie sind keine Widersprüche zur EU-Agrarpolitik, nein, sie müssen ein starker Teil dieser sein, genauso wie etwa das Tierwohl. Nachhaltigkeit muss das Denken und das Handeln bestimmen, und die Bäuerinnen und Bauern müssen ein aktiver Partner auf diesem Weg sein. Genauso wie es wichtig ist, dass wir als Europäische Union unabhängig von Lebensmittelimporten werden. Nun liegt ein Basispaket auf dem Tisch, wo sich die drei größten Fraktionen dieses Hauses geeinigt haben, auch mit einer Stärkung der Ökologisierung, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren. Das dürfen wir nicht in Abrede stellen. Das gibt es in der ersten und zweiten Säule, es gibt eine Stärkung der Konditionalität, und Umweltgelder müssen Umweltgelder bleiben, wenn sie von der ersten in die zweite oder von der zweiten in die erste Säule verschoben werden. In den kommenden Tagen, werte Kolleginnen und Kollegen, geht es aber nun darum, progressive Anträge zu unterstützen und gerade beim Umwelt- und beim Klimaschutzschutz weitere Verbesserungen zu erreichen und natürlich auch immer die Machbarkeit für die Betriebe im Auge zu behalten. Und weiter, was meiner Fraktion natürlich auch sehr wichtig ist, auch beim größten Budgettopf dürfen wir den sozialen Aspekt keineswegs vergessen, er muss sogar berücksichtigt werden. Die Menschen müssen spüren, warum die Europäische Union für sie da ist. Wer bei Erntehelfern oder bei Landarbeitern illegal beschäftigt oder nicht ordentlich sozial absichert, der soll auch keine Gelder aus dem europäischen Landwirtschaftsbudget erhalten.","– Herr Präsident, sehr geehrter Herr Kommissar, sehr geehrte Damen und Herren!

Crescenzio Rivellini ,PPE," Today we gave the green light to new rules that will make motorcycles safer and greener. From 2016, the rules will apply to all two- or three-wheeled motorised vehicles from powered cycles to the most powerful motorcycles. These vehicles are involved in 16 % of road deaths in the EU but account for only 2 % of road traffic, and this is why we have approved tighter safety requirements and imposed stricter targets for reducing polluting emissions. Driving a motor vehicle safely obviously depends mainly on the motorcyclist driving responsibly, but there is always potential to make vehicles safer and cleaner. The new rules to make motorcycles safer include a requirement for motorcycles above 125 cc to be fitted with anti-lock braking systems (ABS), while ABS or a combined braking system (CBS) can be adapted to less powerful vehicles (below 125 cc), including scooters.","Today we gave the green light to new rules that will make motorcycles safer and greener.

João Ferreira ,GUE/NGL," Despite the positive aspects of this report, such as defending the importance of local and regional markets and the promotion of products, it is still contradictory, because it supports and values the current agricultural production model – the same model that has laid waste to the agricultural sector in a number of countries, in particular to small-scale agriculture and family production, compromising their sovereignty and food security. The statement that the ‘success of European farmers will depend on their ability to increase their market share’ is a telling apology for the ‘productivist’, export-based models that sacrifice food quality, security and sovereignty for the ‘competitiveness’ of a few large farms. We do not agree that the indication of European origin should prevail as the main indication of product origin either in the internal market or in third countries. Indicating the national origin, as we now well know, is crucial in supporting, highlighting and promoting national production, shorter supply chains and the operation and value of local and regional markets. These are important (albeit insufficient) measures to help strike an agri-food balance in countries with the highest deficits, such as Portugal.","Despite the positive aspects of this report, such as defending the importance of local and regional markets and the promotion of products, it is still contradictory, because it supports and values the current agricultural production model – the same model that has laid waste to the agricultural sector in a number of countries, in particular to small-scale agriculture and family production, compromising their sovereignty and food security.

Pero hace 20 años, es decir, 30 años después, estuve en La Moneda en una ceremonia emotiva que consistió en abrir la puerta de la calle Morandé, número 80. La calle Morandé es una de las calles que bordean el perímetro de La Moneda. Por esa puerta salió el cadáver de Allende. Y después de que saliera el cadáver de Allende, la dictadura tapió la puerta. Para que nadie se acordara de lo que había pasado allí. Y estuvo cerrada 30 años. Y 30 años después, hace 20, en una sobria y emocionante ceremonia, se volvió a abrir. El presidente Lagos atravesó la calle Morandé desierta y después de recibir novedades de los carabineros, entró en La Moneda por Morandé, 80. Este año allí han colocado las últimas prendas de vestir y los zapatos que llevaba Allende cuando sí se suicidó. No, no lo mataron. Se suicidó. Digamos las cosas como son, pero todo el mundo sabe el sentido de las palabras y de los acontecimientos.  Salvador Allende es una figura mítica en la historia de la lucha por la emancipación y por la justicia. Creo que merece respeto. Merece respeto y merece reconocimiento. Por lo que simboliza. Creo que su nombre es inseparable de la lucha por la justicia. Por la justicia social, en un Chile en el que, cuando él llegó a La Moneda, el 2 % de las familias controlaba el 50 % de la renta nacional. Y en el doscientos de cada mil niños morían precozmente. Una pobreza brutal y, por supuesto, multidimensional, que él se esforzó en intentar corregir. Todos recordamos el impacto que tuvo el golpe de Estado contra Allende, que generó una solidaridad de largo alcance y fortaleció la amistad con el pueblo chileno. Yo mismo tuve en España ocasión de trabajar con algunos de los exiliados que salieron de Chile después del golpe.  Y ahora, en La Moneda, se han vuelto a recordar esos tristes acontecimientos. Y, sí, hay que reconocer que la andadura de Chile, después de que recuperase la democracia, ha demostrado las profundas heridas que ha dejado en esa sociedad la experiencia de la dictadura. Y también que en este momento son necesarios más avances sociales para fortalecer la democracia en Chile.  Pero no tergiversemos la historia. Sí, Allende se suicidó. Se suicidó después del último mensaje a la nación chilena con esas palabras míticas. Cuando dijo que se volverían a abrir más pronto que tarde las grandes alamedas por las que marcharía el hombre libre. Todavía están por abrir muchas alamedas para que esa metáfora sea realidad.  Pero no quiero dejar de decir, frente a aquellos que hoy han mancillado el recuerdo de Allende, que la dictadura chilena dejó detrás de sí a 3 227 asesinados. 3 227 asesinados y 28 459 casos de víctimas de tortura que no llegaron a morir. Y eso, simbolizado por la figura de Allende, merece respeto y acuerdo.","vicepresidente de la Comisión / alto representante de la Unión para Asuntos Exteriores y Política de Seguridad. – Señora presidenta, señorías, gracias por traer al Pleno la memoria de lo que ocurrió en Chile hace 50 años.

Marco Campomenosi,ID," – Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, ringrazio il vicepresidente Šefčovič e il negoziatore Barnier, che ora ha dovuto lasciare la sala.  Nelle mie precedenti esperienze ho imparato tante cose. Mio padre aveva un piccolo esercizio commerciale e ho imparato che il cliente aveva sempre ragione, che chi si recava da lui per acquistare delle cose non doveva essere trattato a schiaffi in faccia. È quello che in parte alcuni incendiari di quest'Aula vorrebbero e hanno fatto perdere molti mesi a un negoziato duro e complesso, ed essendo anche deputato della commissione commercio internazionale, so quanto siano complessi i negoziati commerciali.  Oggi siamo al 18 dicembre e dobbiamo ringraziare soprattutto il fatto che la Gran Bretagna non sia riuscita a stringere un accordo commerciale con gli Stati Uniti. Avrebbe probabilmente sostituito alcune delle merci che normalmente arrivano dal nostro mercato unico verso di loro. Qualcuno lo ha detto, c'è stata poca trasparenza. Alcuni gruppi politici sono totalmente esclusi dal flusso di informazioni. Questo è normale, lo so, avviene anche per altri negoziati commerciali, ma è uno dei problemi su cui, con gli amici della commissione commercio internazionale, sapete benissimo, abbiamo discusso ed è un problema che vale oggi e varrà anche per il futuro.  Io non sono d'accordo con chi lamenta del livello degli standard della Gran Bretagna perché, se era un paese che era con noi fino all'altro giorno, lo stesso Parlamento europeo che dà l'ok ad accordi commerciali con realtà asiatiche che non rispettano standard ambientali, diritti dei lavoratori; non abbiamo sospeso la Turchia dall'unione doganale con l'Unione europea, voglio dire, sarebbe quanto meno ipocrita sollevare questi aspetti, in questa fase. Quindi voltiamo pagina, pensiamo a imprese e lavoratori europei e cerchiamo di comprendere la lezione che è giunta dalla Brexit.","– Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, ringrazio il vicepresidente Šefčovič e il negoziatore Barnier, che ora ha dovuto lasciare la sala.

Joachim Stanisław Brudziński,ECR,"w imieniu grupy ECR. – Pani Przewodnicząca! Niestety należy z przykrością odnotować, że ta niezwykle ważna debata z punktu widzenia bezpieczeństwa obywateli całej Unii Europejskiej znowu przerodziła się, przynajmniej w wystąpieniach niektórych z państwa, w pretekst do ataku na polski rząd. Z olbrzymią przykrością odnotowuję, że szef największej frakcji w Parlamencie Europejskim, pan Manfred Weber, po raz kolejny atakuje polski rząd. Dzisiaj nie odwołał się do Donalda Tuska, jak miało to miejsce podczas ostatniej debaty na temat Polski. A jedyne słowa, jakie dzisiaj powinny paść z tej mównicy, to słowa pod adresem polskich funkcjonariuszy straży granicznej, polskiego wojska, polskiej policji, którzy dbają wspólnie ze swoimi odpowiednikami w Hiszpanii, w Grecji, we Włoszech o to, aby państwo mogli wygadywać te niestworzone dyrdymały. Przegłosowaliście dzisiaj jako większość lewicowa, że będziemy dyskutować na temat sytuacji humanitarnej na granicy polsko-białoruskiej. No już kiedyś przegłosowaliście, że ślimak to ryba, że marchewka to owoc, możecie przegłosować, że nie ma płci, że tata to mama, a mama to tata, tylko co to ma wspólnego ze zdrowym rozsądkiem?  Ja bardzo dziękuję za ten rozsądny głos mówiący wyraźnie o tym, że ta sytuacja, która dzisiaj dotyka całą Unię Europejską, jest hybrydową wojną wymierzoną przez zbrodniczy reżim Łukaszenki i jego protektora z Moskwy w bezpieczeństwo całej Unii Europejskiej. Jeżeli my poprzez tego typu debaty będziemy dawali sygnał – tak jak mówił to bardzo celnie pan wysoki przedstawiciel do spraw zagranicznych – tym nieszczęśnikom w państwach Sahelu, Bliskiego Wschodu, że mogą tutaj przyjechać, bo się nimi zajmiemy, bo otworzymy szeroko drzwi, to będziemy mieli powtórkę z 2015 r. Ci wszyscy, którzy dzisiaj z tej mównicy mówią, że powinniśmy otworzyć granice, zaopiekować się tymi nieszczęśnikami, tak naprawdę napędzacie kasę tym, którzy organizują przemyt tych nieszczęśników. Niech ta refleksja do was w końcu dotrze. Dzisiaj wpływy z handlu ludźmi, z organizacji nielegalnej migracji są większe niż z handlu bronią czy narkotykami. Tego typu debaty, jakie dzisiaj toczą się przy udziale przedstawicieli nieodpowiedzialnej lewicy, tak naprawdę zachęcają kolejne setki tysięcy mieszkańców Czadu, Mali, Senegalu, Somalii czy państw Bliskiego Wschodu, żeby tutaj do Europy dotarli.

Alain Cadec ,PPE," There has been a phenomenal increase in air traffic during the last few years. Despite numerous technological improvements, the risk of accidents has increased. Therefore, it is essential to adapt EU legislation on this subject. I therefore welcome Mrs De Veyrac’s proposals to adapt the 1994 directive on accident prevention to the current situation in the aviation market. By creating a network of national investigation authorities, it will be possible to reduce the disparities that exist between the Member States, notably through pooling resources and exchanging best practices. The rights of victims and their families must also be protected. I support the rapporteur’s request for the obligation for airlines to supply a passenger list within one hour of the notification of the occurrence of an accident to apply not only to EU airlines, but also to all airlines that operate within Europe. Finally, I welcome the rapporteur’s proposal for the European Aviation Safety Agency to be described as an ‘adviser’ when participating in safety investigations. It is important for the regulation not to give the agency the scope to be both judge and jury during safety investigations.","There has been a phenomenal increase in air traffic during the last few years.

György Schöpflin ,PPE,"The Baltic Sea Strategy promoted by the Swedish Presidency is very welcome. It could readily assume a model function for other European macroregions, like the Danube basin. There is, however, one aspect of the development of the Baltic Sea region that demands urgent reconsideration. This is the Nord Stream sea-bed pipeline between Russia and Germany. Not only is the pipeline the source of serious environmental concern, but – even more urgently – it is a project that has been overtaken by time. The future is not in fixed means of delivering natural gas – via pipelines – but through liquefied natural gas. Nord Stream has every likelihood of being a wholly unnecessary white elephant, and its protagonists should reconsider the project before more money and more resources, effort and energy are tied up in it.","The Baltic Sea Strategy promoted by the Swedish Presidency is very welcome.

José Manuel Fernandes ,PPE," The creation of a space for freedom in the heart of the multiple realities constituting the European Union cannot be achieved without guaranteeing equal conditions for any European citizen anywhere in the EU area, specifically in access to justice, which is a fundamental value of democracy and of any state following the rule of law. For this reason, I support the establishment of a directive that guarantees common standards for interpretation and translation in criminal justice proceedings in all Member States of the European Union, allowing any citizen outside their country of origin the right to express themselves and to be informed in their native language, or in another language deemed acceptable by them, in police interrogations or in court hearings. Considering the importance of ensuring a more just Europe for the consolidation of European integration, I call for these new measures to be applied as quickly as possible in all Member States, and for the European Union to continue with the process of greater harmonisation in the area of guaranteeing rights and legal procedures.","The creation of a space for freedom in the heart of the multiple realities constituting the European Union cannot be achieved without guaranteeing equal conditions for any European citizen anywhere in the EU area, specifically in access to justice, which is a fundamental value of democracy and of any state following the rule of law.

Auke Zijlstra,ID,"Voorzitter, ergens onderweg is de Europese Unie van de oplossing het probleem geworden. In mijn Commissie LIBE zie je de toekomst van de EU verschijnen: een litanie van wetten die de soevereiniteit van lidstaten aantast en de heiligheid van de EU benadrukt. De nationale parlementen gaan straks helemaal nergens meer over: niet over monetair beleid, niet over sociaal beleid, niet over privacy, niet over strafwetgeving, niet over migratie, en ook niet over wie er wel en niet in hun land mag verkeren. Het nu gepresenteerde inreis-uitreissysteem is daar een heel mooi voorbeeld van: lidstaten verliezen hun vrijheid om de buitengrenzen te controleren en in plaats daarvan komt er dan een systeem van scanners en databases. Er zijn meerdere doelen geformuleerd, waaronder het bestrijden van terrorisme en zware misdaad. Ging dat vóór Schengen niet goed dan? In het nieuwe systeem worden van toeristen weliswaar de paspoorten gescand voordat ze de EU in mogen, maar terroristen die illegaal met bootjes arriveren, kunnen zo doorlopen. Dus hoe helpt dit dan? Bovendien blijken aanslagplegers later altijd al bekend bij de geheime diensten, maar werden ze gewoon niet opgepakt, want ja, we slagen er ook niet in om te bedenken hoe we om moeten gaan met de islam. En misdaad, ja, dat is in Nederland in groeiende mate een gevolg van rondreizende bendes die door het ontbreken van binnengrenzen juist alle ruimte krijgen. Dus waarom is dit beter? Wie wil dit? Het nieuwe systeem zou ook moeten helpen tegen illegaliteit, omdat de computer op een gegeven moment weet wanneer iemand langer is gebleven dan mag. Maar illegalen gaan helemaal niet meer weg. Ze worden ook niet uitgezet. Ook daar hebben we geen oplossing voor. Dus waarom dan toch dit systeem? Voorzitter, dit systeem gaat niet helpen tegen terrorisme. Het helpt ook niet tegen misdaad.

Benita Ferrero-Waldner,N/A,"Mr President, in my remarks, I shall touch upon the forthcoming EU-US Summit that will be an important milestone in our transatlantic partnership, as well as addressing certain EU-US aspects, particularly on climate change negotiations under way and also some critical GLS issues. The change in the US Administration in January has had a very significant impact on EU-US relations, and our partnership has got off to a good start. I would say we have re-energised our relations and I am convinced that the Lisbon Treaty, once in force, will also contribute towards the further strengthening of this vital relationship by providing the European Union with an even stronger foreign policy identity. That is also what our friends in Washington expect. But let us be also clear. Our aspiration for a true partnership of equals with the United States also means that Europeans must be willing and able to deliver. I would say that it is a dual momentum, internal and external, that makes the summit in Washington so important. The first formal summit with President Obama took place after our informal meeting in Prague this spring. Now the preparations for the Washington Summit are in full swing. We are working with the US side on delivering tangible results in priority areas. The global economy and climate change are likely to be the two major areas of focus of the summit discussion, in addition to a number of key foreign policy challenges. On the economy, the focus in Washington will be on joint efforts to combat the economic and financial crisis and securing a sustainable global economic recovery to secure jobs and create growth. We will move further on governance issues for the global economy, notably on financial regulation and a timely follow-up to the G20 Pittsburgh Summit. The Commission will also emphasise our joint interest in countering protectionist tendencies and we will call on the US to renew efforts to bring the Doha Round to a successful end. Secondly, on climate change, we as the European Union will encourage the US to go to the Copenhagen conference with ambitious objectives to reach a sound global agreement, and we will also engage with the US to make progress on establishing a cap-and-trade system across the Atlantic. Thirdly, on foreign policy, we will, of course, also discuss with the US how to meet urgent foreign policy challenges. Here we will focus on how to cooperate further and more closely on the Middle East peace process, on the challenges posed by the nuclear ambitions of Iran, and on ways in which we can assure the renewal of the compact in Afghanistan, which is at the basis of our concerted efforts there. I will have a separate foreign policy meeting with Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Bildt to discuss these matters in greater detail. Furthermore, I expect the summit also to adopt a declaration on non-proliferation and disarmament, taking forward EU-US cooperation in many of the areas identified by President Obama in his speeches in Prague and New York. This initiative, which carries strategic importance in itself, is indicative of the renewed US commitment towards effective multilateralism, which the European Union has every intention of supporting and consolidating. Last but not least, a further major summit outcome will be the creation of a new EU-US Energy Council which will have its first meeting on 4 November. On the EU side, the Council will be chaired by myself, my colleagues, Commissioners Piebalgs and Potočnik, and the Presidency, and on the US side by Secretary Clinton and Secretary Chu. The Council will look at global energy security, energy markets and product regulation, at new technologies and research. In short, it will provide added value in a policy field, the importance of which is obvious. Now there is also a new Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC). That will be complementary to the Energy Council, which we will re-energise as well. The TEC meets in Washington next Tuesday – so before the Energy Council – and its outcome will obviously feed into the summit talks as well. A promising area in our transatlantic cooperation is what we call upstream cooperation. We will discuss policy approaches early on, so that we will avoid divergent regulation down the road. It goes without saying that we need such cooperation more than ever. The needed coherent response to the financial crisis is the best example for it. We will also explore whether we can intensify this forum of cooperation for nanomaterial health care-related information. Upon a US initiative, we also intend to launch closer cooperation in the area of innovation. Both sides recognise that enhancing the innovative potential of our industries and our workforces is essential for the creation of jobs and growth and therefore for a successful emergence of the coming crisis. And the Commission, of course, will also repeat our European concerns on some critical issues such as securing trade, potential distortions of competition from State aid and procurement policy in the US. Finally, we as the Commission have also, from the very beginning, strongly relied on the European Parliament’s support for the TEC process, and we are grateful for this. So rest assured that we will very much support the initiatives by the European Parliament’s delegations for relations with the USA to strengthen parliamentary involvement in TEC matters on both sides of the Atlantic. We would like to consolidate the TEC’s role as a bilateral forum to address both day-to-day and strategic issues regarding transatlantic trade and investment. And importantly, the TEC will have reached out to the transatlantic legislators’ dialogue and civil society stakeholders, too, so clearly we need the expertise and political thrust of legislators to tap the full potential of the transatlantic market place. My colleague has already mentioned that GLS will also be very important. There will be a Troika meeting on GLS affairs on 27 and 28 October in Washington, in the framework of our cooperation on justice, freedom and security. Vice-President Barrot will represent the Commission. We are in the final stages of preparing a statement that will aim to renew our transatlantic partnership in these areas. In the Washington meeting, there will be the opportunity formally to exchange the instruments of ratification of the extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements so that they can enter into force in early 2010. These agreements will strengthen our efforts in fighting crime in today’s globalised world. On another critical matter close to the hearts of the citizens, we certainly need to make further progress, as was mentioned. We will reiterate the call for visa-free travel to the US for all EU citizens; we will express our concern over the prospect of a fee for the electronic system for travel authorisation as the de facto new tourist tax; and we will once again remind the US of the need to lift the restrictions on travellers with HIV/AIDS under the US visa waiver programme, as you have mentioned. Finally, a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will be travelling to Washington around the time of the ministerial meeting, so we trust they will also be able to convey the same messages. Vice-President Barrot is also ready to meet the Committee on Civil Liberties delegation while in Washington.","Mr President, in my remarks, I shall touch upon the forthcoming EU-US Summit that will be an important milestone in our transatlantic partnership, as well as addressing certain EU-US aspects, particularly on climate change negotiations under way and also some critical GLS issues.

Zweitens: Bei der Krisenbewältigung haben wir es in Europa zu stark zugelassen, dass Entscheidungen getroffen wurden ohne Parlamentsbeteiligung.

Elisa Ferreira ,S&D,"Mr President, this debate is extremely important. The three Presidents who co-signed the Five Presidents’ Report are here and we are, for the first time, discussing in plenary the stance and functioning of the eurozone. So this moment is very welcome indeed.  The truth is that, more than seven years after the 2008 crisis, in spite of the welcome massive quantitative easing by the European Central Bank and also in spite of a more intelligent application of the governance rules by the Commission, the eurozone economy is stagnant. It is basically flat with strong internal divergences and alarming levels of poverty and unemployment. The reality confirms what we have repeatedly been saying here and what President Draghi said in 2014, which is that in a recessive economic environment, monetary union alone is not enough to boost the economy. In a zero lower bound interest rate and stagnant economy, investment projects are hardly viable, thus limiting the potential to increase competitiveness and create new jobs, while non-performing loans jeopardise the viability of banks and other lenders.  So the Commission and Council urgently need to acknowledge that the policies which have been imposed until now need urgent change. In 2015, GDP per head and the level of productive investment in the euro area remain below the levels in 2007. The future of the EU – and in particular the future of the eurozone and its acceptance by its citizens – depends on this policy change. Change means that the eurozone cannot, in 2016, pursue a neutral aggregate fiscal stance as, once again, is being proposed by the Commission and the Council. It is suicidal to ignore the facts and to persist in this neutral stance. The aggregate fiscal stance should instead be expansionist, clearly countercyclical, protect productive investment and limit internal divergent trends. But what instruments do we have? Until now, only pre-crisis external deficit countries have adjusted, whereas external surplus countries continue to increase their current account surpluses. The surplus largely reflects excess domestic savings over investment, which leaves the eurozone without a stimulus. This asymmetric adjustment, incapable of generating internal investment or conception, is further reducing the viability of the common currency. Apart from interpreting the existing rules in a wiser way, we need immediately to prepare for the next phase of the 2015 Five Presidents’ report, which is already a diluted version of the 2012 Van Rompuy report. But we need to prepare immediately for the establishment of conditions to create a fiscal capacity for the eurozone. Without a reinforced budget, monetary union cannot function. European institutions also need to respect and comply with all the promises made, on the banking union in particular, by urgently providing an indispensable permanent credible backstop to the single resolution mechanism, by accelerating the common guarantee of deposits, and by allowing the ESM to directly recapitalise banks. I recall that this element is included in the first phase of the Five Presidents’ Report. I do not think that this can be a trade—off for anything else. It is just finishing what has been promised. This is essential for mutual trust and the belief of citizens.","Mr President, this debate is extremely important.

Edvard Kožušník ,ECR," I support this report, because the development of payment systems can significantly influence the development of the internal market. An important role is played by standardisation, which facilitates the entry of new operators. The application of standards in all areas of electronic payment systems is the way to ensure full interoperability of payment models and a method of eliminating the risk of closing the market to potential competitors and innovation. I still perceive barriers hindering the development of payment instruments in the digital market in several areas. This particularly concerns the fundamental problems of different domestic debit card systems that do not work outside the boundaries of particular states. Other obstacles are to be found in the field of electronic payments, which lie in the fragmentation of national solutions and inadequate framework for the implementation of micropayments. I can also see another barrier in mobile payments, which suffer from the inability of key mobile operators to find common ground with phone manufacturers and credit card companies. All payment methods are then faced with one fundamental problem, whereby despite the massive increase in the volume of transactions, average merchant fees do not decrease according to the payment made, either for consumers or for merchants.","I support this report, because the development of payment systems can significantly influence the development of the internal market.

The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) confirms that there have been irregularities in the calculation of duties on tomato imports and that this has been damaging to European producers, the very same producers who are expressing their concern at the expected increase in tomato and fruit and vegetable imports in general that will take place if the agreement is signed. We are obviously sensitive to the concerns brought about by bilateral agreements where the agricultural element is often sacrificed for the sake of broader industrial interests. It is not a good way to proceed, and we will continue to repeat this to the European Commission. However, I would like to point out that the current economic and political crisis throughout the Maghreb area should lead us to consider this agreement carefully and with greater solidarity.","Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the petition under discussion today has arrived at a time when Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its Committee on International Trade are debating the new chapter on agriculture in the agreement with Morocco.

Miriam Dalli,S&D,"on behalf of the S&D Group. – Mr President, timing is everything and the Climate Action Summit and the Sustainable Development Goals Summit are critical in helping us address the global climate emergency we are facing. The European Union needs to agree on a climate plan that provides an overall level of ambition, ensuring that the required transition takes place and providing the necessary financial means, together with the horizontal policies that need to be set. As things stand today, even if all the 2030 pledges were to be fully implemented, we would not be on track to achieve the Paris Agreement targets. The European Union has the potential and the duty to act ambitiously before 2030 and to adopt and implement a vision for a future climate-neutral and fossil-fuel-free environment. We require clear decarbonisation strategies by different sectors. We require action plans that clearly show how these strategies will be achieved and how they will be financed. They will require changes in sectors like transport, building, industry, agriculture and forestry. Climate change is a global challenge and solutions need to be global too, as the Commissioner himself indicated. But the European Union needs to continue in its leadership role, whilst providing support to the most vulnerable countries that are mostly affected by climate change. We need collective action and, as part of Parliament’s delegation to the Summit, I want to hear a strong European voice that is not afraid of putting forward ambitious programmes, because weak commitments would undermine our communities, our industries, our economies, our youth and our children. It is only through EU leadership that we can speed up global action on the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change goals and the EU should not shy away from its responsibilities. ","on behalf of the S&D Group. – Mr President, timing is everything and the Climate Action Summit and the Sustainable Development Goals Summit are critical in helping us address the global climate emergency we are facing. The European Union needs to agree on a climate plan that provides an overall level of ambition, ensuring that the required transition takes place and providing the necessary financial means, together with the horizontal policies that need to be set. As things stand today, even if all the 2030 pledges were to be fully implemented, we would not be on track to achieve the Paris Agreement targets. The European Union has the potential and the duty to act ambitiously before 2030 and to adopt and implement a vision for a future climate-neutral and fossil-fuel-free environment. We require clear decarbonisation strategies by different sectors. We require action plans that clearly show how these strategies will be achieved and how they will be financed. They will require changes in sectors like transport, building, industry, agriculture and forestry.

Heidi Hautala,Greens/EFA," – Mr President, after the first euphoric reactions to the new opportunities, some realistic opportunities do arise. I’d like to touch on one of them, and that is the worthy fight against modern slavery and forced labour in global value chains.  Modern slavery is a part of the lives of 30 to 47 million people in the world today. The United States has had a ban on the importation of forced labour slavery products since 1930. The newest version puts an obligation on companies to prove that there is no forced labour included in the value chains of their imports. If they cannot do so, the imports will be stopped.  As the President of the Commission has recently announced, the Commission is planning a similar type of instrument in the EU, and I believe this is a distinct trade and customs policy instrument. The question of Uyghur forced labour, is of course behind a lot of these discussions, and that is a very worthy cause. I talked recently to the Customs and Border Protection authorities of the United States, and it’s now clear that the EU risks becoming a safe haven for products produced with the help of forced labour. According to their statistics, imports of Uyghur—produced cotton to the United States have decreased, while they have recently increased to the European Union. It is the same with palm oil, which is not only connected to deforestation, but also to forced labour. We have to act now.

Cela confirme que toutes les accusations précédentes n’étaient rien d’autre que de l’hystérie politique créée contre le gouvernement conservateur de droite de la Pologne. Une fois encore, il est inacceptable que les gauchistes de ce Parlement mettent en doute l’exactitude de cette décision et poursuivent leurs attaques idéologiques. Il est grand temps que la gauche européenne se rende compte que les débats idéologiques mesquins n’ont pas leur place en ce moment, alors que nous sommes confrontés à une terrible guerre dans notre voisinage immédiat. La guerre en Ukraine nous a profondément secoués et elle a créé une situation politique et sécuritaire entièrement nouvelle. De plus, l’Europe est confrontée à une crise économique, alimentaire, énergétique et des réfugiés sans précédent. Nous devons donc traiter ces questions dans une grande unité et avec une force indéfectible. Il est tout à fait irresponsable – un véritable suicide, je dois dire – de dresser les États membres les uns contre les autres dans la situation actuelle. Ce dont nous avons besoin, c’est d’une confiance et d’un respect mutuels et non d’explosions inconsidérées contre des dirigeants et des gouvernements qui défendent leur souveraineté, leurs convictions et leurs intérêts nationaux.

Dorien Rookmaker,ECR," – Voorzitter, graag vraag ik uw aandacht voor het volgende: afgelopen woensdag 31 mei hebben slachtoffers van de Nederlandse overheid in Brussel voor het Parlement gedemonstreerd. Ze wilden een onderzoek naar de toeslagenaffaire. Meer dan 30 000 ouders die in een ingewikkeld systeem op een fout bij de aanvraag voor subsidie werden betrapt, werden ten onrechte als fraudeur weggezet. Er is in het Parlement al eerder aandacht voor gevraagd. De Nederlandse overheid eiste de verstrekte subsidie terug en bracht daarmee duizenden ouders in moeilijkheden. Ze verloren hun baan, hun huis, soms hun bedrijf. Duizenden kinderen zijn uit huis geplaatst. Sommige ouders zijn zelfs vanwege deze zaak met de kinderen naar het buitenland gevlucht. Er zijn zelfs gevallen van zelfmoord bekend. Alle getroffenen hebben in een nachtmerrie geleefd waarbij ontwaken onmogelijk leek. De Nederlandse regering heeft schuld bekend, maar pas nadat dit schandaal jaren onder de pet is gehouden. De regering wist dat ze fout zat, maar liet de slachtoffers in onwetendheid. In Europa zijn weinigen van dit drama op de hoogte. Het handelen van de Nederlandse regering is in strijd met alle Europese verdragen en afspraken die de bescherming van de mensenrechten bepalen. Het komt niet vaak voor dat de Nederlandse regering in de EU voor een mensenrechtenkwestie op het matje wordt geroepen, maar in deze kwestie is het volledig op zijn plaats.","– Voorzitter, graag vraag ik uw aandacht voor het volgende: afgelopen woensdag 31 mei hebben slachtoffers van de Nederlandse overheid in Brussel voor het Parlement gedemonstreerd.

Ze verloren hun baan, hun huis, soms hun bedrijf. Duizenden kinderen zijn uit huis geplaatst. Sommige ouders zijn zelfs vanwege deze zaak met de kinderen naar het buitenland gevlucht. Er zijn zelfs gevallen van zelfmoord bekend. Alle getroffenen hebben in een nachtmerrie geleefd waarbij ontwaken onmogelijk leek. De Nederlandse regering heeft schuld bekend, maar pas nadat dit schandaal jaren onder de pet is gehouden. De regering wist dat ze fout zat, maar liet de slachtoffers in onwetendheid. In Europa zijn weinigen van dit drama op de hoogte. Het handelen van de Nederlandse regering is in strijd met alle Europese verdragen en afspraken die de bescherming van de mensenrechten bepalen. Het komt niet vaak voor dat de Nederlandse regering in de EU voor een mensenrechtenkwestie op het matje wordt geroepen, maar in deze kwestie is het volledig op zijn plaats.","– Voorzitter, graag vraag ik uw aandacht voor het volgende: afgelopen woensdag 31 mei hebben slachtoffers van de Nederlandse overheid in Brussel voor het Parlement gedemonstreerd.

Maxette Pirbakas,NI," – Madame la Présidente, Monsieur le rapporteur, à mon avis, ce rapport sur les régions frontalières ne fait pas l’impasse sur l’outre-mer. Parce que oui, nous sommes aussi des régions frontalières. J’apprécie cette attention portée aux territoires qui ont un besoin particulier d’Europe, surtout dans le contexte très difficile que nous connaissons actuellement. Adaptation et pragmatisme sont les deux ambitions que nous devons porter pour les régions frontalières, parmi lesquelles nos départements d’outre-mer. Adaptation parce que nous sommes confrontés à des réalités locales très spécifiques, et pragmatisme afin d’agir sans idéologie, au plus près des problèmes que nous subissons. C’est pourquoi je salue la perspective que trace votre rapport de développer les coopérations transfrontalières. Bien sûr, nous le savons, nous qui sommes loin du continent, les meilleurs axes de développement se trouvent souvent dans la coopération avec des régions dépendant d’États tiers situés dans notre zone géographique. Notre histoire ultramarine s’est construite dans un rapport de satellisation vis-à-vis de la centralité du continent européen. Nous sommes désormais conscients qu’il faut rompre avec ce cercle vicieux qui bride le développement des régions frontalières et singulièrement de l’outre-mer.

Regina Bastos ,PPE," On 29 September 2010, the Commission tabled a legislative package aimed at strengthening economic governance in the European Union and the euro area. The strengthening of economic governance must be linked to a strengthening of the democratic legitimacy of decisions made. In other words, it requires closer and more timely involvement of the interested parties, as well as of national parliaments and the European Parliament. This report, for which I voted, sets out detailed rules on the detection of macroeconomic imbalances, as well as the prevention and correction of excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the Union. The aim is a warning mechanism to facilitate the early identification and monitoring of imbalances. If the measures taken or provided for in the programme of corrective measures or the relevant schedule for implementation are considered inadequate, the Council adopts, on a recommendation from the Commission, a recommendation for the Member States to submit a new corrective action plan within two months. The Commission’s recommendation on non-compliance is to be considered adopted by the Council unless the Council decides to reject the recommendation by a qualified majority within 10 days of its adoption by the Commission. The Member States may request that a meeting of the Council be convened to vote on the decision.","On 29 September 2010, the Commission tabled a legislative package aimed at strengthening economic governance in the European Union and the euro area.

Birgit Sippel,S&D," – Herr Präsident! Seit letzter Woche gelten die digitalen COVID-Zertifikate, um die Reisefreiheit in der Pandemie zu erleichtern. Das ist zunächst ein gutes Zeichen. Doch trotz Zertifikaten, trotz neuer Ratsempfehlungen für einheitlichere Reiseregeln bahnt sich im Umgang mit den Virusvarianten ein neuer Flickenteppich an Einschränkungen an. Menschen aus der gleichen Region müssen in Mitgliedstaat A in Quarantäne, in Mitgliedstaat B gibt es keinerlei Beschränkungen. Dieses unkoordinierte und intransparente Vorgehen führt zu Verunsicherung und zur Verärgerung unserer Bürgerinnen und Bürger. Es beeinträchtigt die Akzeptanz und einfache Verwendung der Zertifikate, und es schwächt das Vertrauen in europäische Entscheidungen. Deshalb an den Rat: Was tun Sie konkret, damit überall einheitlichere Regeln gelten? Neben gemeinsamen verbindlichen Kriterien würden auch kostenlose Tests den Start der Zertifikate erleichtern, gerade für diejenigen, die sich noch nicht impfen lassen konnten oder wollten. 100 Millionen Euro stehen für Schnelltests zur Verfügung, die Kommission hatte weitere Mittel in Aussicht gestellt. Das ist aber wohl nicht mehr Teil der Pläne von Kommissar Reynders, trotz Berichten, dass gerade ärmere Bevölkerungsgruppen noch nicht sehr gut geimpft sind.

Evelyn Regner ,S&D," People who habitually work in multiple Member States of the EU should be socially insured wherever the main focus of their life is. The new regulation on the coordination of social security systems aims to close current loopholes and take account of the changes in national legislation. The new rules are crucial, above all, for flight attendants and self-employed frontier workers. The social security system is, and remains, self-evidently the responsibility of individual Member States. However, we are ensuring that these systems can also be made use of by, and are fair to, those people who work in multiple EU countries as a result of the greater mobility that now exists. It should not be of decisive importance where the registered office of a company is. The decisive factor for social security is the home base, which is to say, the place where someone has the main focus of their life, from which they usually make their journeys. Low-cost airlines were responsible for wage and social dumping in the past, when, for example, Belgian stewardesses were registered with the less beneficial Irish social security system. We are now putting paid to such practices. This is a new regulation of Europe’s internal market that does not permit any dumping in relation to social security systems and ensures greater legal certainty. It takes us one step closer to a more social Europe.","People who habitually work in multiple Member States of the EU should be socially insured wherever the main focus of their life is.

Mirosław Piotrowski ,ECR," Mr President, the motion which has been submitted for a resolution of Parliament on the Common Foreign and Security Policy is intended, among other things, to establish military structures as part of the European Union. I appeal for the establishment of a special European Union defence council and military operations centre. These instruments will serve to give the Union the status of a world player in military affairs. It should be remembered that out of 27 EU Member States, as many as 21 are members of NATO. Only six EU countries do not belong to NATO, and most of these have declared neutrality. This gives rise, therefore, to a fundamental question – does the motion which has been submitted have as an objective the development of a number of EU countries, or is it also a serious step on the road to building a separate military bloc in competition with NATO? Even in the mid-term perspective, it will not be possible to maintain membership in both organisations at the same time. Therefore, voting in favour of this report, today, will, in reality, destroy the civil nature of the Union, will show the red card to NATO and will be the beginning of building an alternative military bloc.","Mr President, the motion which has been submitted for a resolution of Parliament on the Common Foreign and Security Policy is intended, among other things, to establish military structures as part of the European Union.

Nuno Teixeira ,PPE," The free movement of individuals is one of the fundamental principles of the European Union, and the Schengen area was created in order to put this objective into practice effectively. The Group of the European People’s Party, to which I belong, has always defended the principle of the freedom of movement of individuals, following the principle that rules and common procedures regarding visas, residence permits and the control of borders must form part of the full Schengen concept. In this context, I support the new measures which have been adopted, taking into account the fact that the free movement of nationals of third countries, that is, residents of a Member State on the basis of a type D long-stay visa travelling to other Member States within the Schengen area, is sometimes rendered difficult as a result of a delay in the conversion of their visa into a residence permit. In accordance with the document, the principle of equivalence between residence permits and short-stay visas will now be applied to long-stay visas. For these reasons, and given that the adopted measures not only leave matters relating to the granting of visas unaffected, including those relating to security issues, but also constitute a natural and necessary development of the Schengen concept, I voted in favour of the document.","The free movement of individuals is one of the fundamental principles of the European Union, and the Schengen area was created in order to put this objective into practice effectively.

Medidas como o Mecanismo Europeu de Estabilidade, o estabelecimento de um mecanismo de mutualização da dívida pública e o alargamento do sistema de recursos próprios da UE, entre outras, devem avançar já, sem hesitações ou demoras, para ajudar no presente e garantir o nosso futuro.","por escrito. – O novo coronavírus veio colocar a Europa e o mundo diante de um cenário devastador.

José Manuel Barroso,N/A,"First of all, regarding the issue of the funeral, I want to keep it completely separate from the rest. I had a great respect for President Kaczyński. I worked in a very loyal manner with him. I did everything to be present at his funeral. I was present at all the ceremonies that I could attend marking the deaths of President Kaczyński, his wife and all those that were killed in that tragic accident. I really do not understand how it is possible to make this kind of criticism against the European institutions, by using the death of so many people. I was trying to go to the funeral of President Kaczyński until the very last moment. The problem is that only on Saturday, very late in the evening, I received the information that the flight that was organised by the Belgian authorities was cancelled. It was no longer possible for me to go. So I want to make it absolutely clear that I have done everything I could to pay tribute, not only to the people who died in the tragic accident, but to Poland as a nation. Regarding the issue, if I may now use the other minute to answer the question on the aviation sector, we are aware of the very important impact on industry of this volcanic problem and that is why we are already doing our work to see how we can in fact help, if needed, the European aviation industry. They are suffering severe economic losses, which are caused by not being allowed to carry out their commercial activities for several days. It is necessary to look for a global solution to help the industry out of the crisis and, in fact, we have a precedent, which was the crisis after 11 September. So we are looking at possible ways in terms of alleviation of the State aid rules, as we have done in the past. We discussed this in the college meeting today.","First of all, regarding the issue of the funeral, I want to keep it completely separate from the rest. I had a great respect for President Kaczyński.

Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert,ALDE,"Mr President, officially I could now sum up the parts of our 27-page resolution that are most relevant for the other groups, but I will not. I would like to share the following story with you. On a British Airways flight from Johannesburg, a well-off, middle-aged white South African lady found herself sitting next to a black man. She called the stewardess over to complain about her seating. ‘What seems to be the problem, Madam?’ ‘Well, can’t you see?’ she said, ‘I can’t possibly sit next to this disgusting human. Find me another seat!’ A few minutes later, the stewardess returned. ‘Madam, unfortunately, as I suspected, economy class is full. I have spoken to the cabin services director and Club is also full. However, we do have one seat in first class.’ Before the South African lady had a chance to answer, the stewardess continued, ‘It is quite exceptional to make this kind of upgrade, but given the circumstances the captain felt that it was outrageous that someone should be forced to sit next to such an obnoxious person.’ She then turned to the black man sitting next to the South African lady and said, ‘Sir, if you would like to get your things, I have a seat ready for you in first class up at the front.’ The surrounding passengers gave a standing ovation while the black man walked up to first class. Now, what has this got to do with us? Do we consider others inferior? The white South African lady would shock us all. But that was obviously an extreme example. However, I do think that some of our colleagues in the EPP in particular, but also in the Council, understand perfectly what I am trying to say here. The other group, my group, firmly believes in a Europe which people can understand, trust and believe in. Such a Europe must be based on human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy, the rule of law and, yes, true equality for all. It is high time to tackle all forms of discrimination on all grounds, including on the basis of sexual orientation.","Mr President, officially I could now sum up the parts of our 27-page resolution that are most relevant for the other groups, but I will not.

Barry Andrews,ALDE,"on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, I listened to your speech and I was struck by how you characterised the achievement of loss and damage. And it is an enormous achievement because one felt immediately afterwards that it wasn’t presented in that way by the Commission, that somehow or another the G77 position was challenged and maybe there was a better way to do it than loss and damage. And I listened to the distinction you draw between 1992 and today and different developing countries, and all of those are very legitimate. But this is an enormous achievement – what has been done at COP27 – because for the first time it recognises those who pollute more, those who possess more must do more, and that if you break it, which we did, you fix it, which we should, and that is now locked into the principle of how we’re going to approach this issue. It’s about climate justice, something that my compatriot Mary Robinson has spoken so passionately about over the years. And it’s an achievement because we have a credibility problem in the European Union. I’ve just come back from Marrakech, where I had discussions with my African liberal colleagues over two days, and they are struck by the fact that we’re opening coal mines, you’ve mentioned it yourself, Commissioner, they are struck by the fact that we’re pricing them out of the LNG market, that we have allowed for loopholes in relation to gas exploration, and they are challenging us to be real partners on this issue. And I sincerely believe that we have to get over the credibility issue that is really challenging the European Union. And I will say, finally, that I think you are correct in saying that we have made a solid achievement here, but we also cannot gaslight G77 countries with the positions that they rightfully took.","on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, I listened to your speech and I was struck by how you characterised the achievement of loss and damage.

Willy Meyer ,GUE/NGL," The armed conflict in the area can only be resolved by way of a political solution. All intervention by neighbouring and other countries must therefore cease. A diplomatic solution negotiated between the parties is required to bring the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to an end. Such a solution must comply fully with the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The United Nations Security Council should review the mandate of MONUC. The mandate under Chapter VII should be done away with, to avoid strengthening the Congolese Armed Forces, thus endangering the United Nations peacekeeping mission. We call for the EUPOL and EUSEC missions to the DRC to be closed down. These missions have made a negative contribution to the escalation of violence and to the deteriorating situation in the country because they have trained security forces that have gone on to commit crimes against their own civilian population. United Nations resolutions concerning an embargo on the supply of arms to the DRC must be implemented. We wish to report that several Member States of the European Union are violating that embargo. The joint resolution tabled by the other political groups does not refer to these fundamental points, and I have therefore voted against it.","The armed conflict in the area can only be resolved by way of a political solution.

Dimitris Avramopoulos,N/A,"Madam President, our debate today, ahead of the vote, is inevitably on an important priority, for, as we all know, it is linked to Schengen. Preserving and strengthening Schengen is one of the Commission’s – and my personal – priorities. Schengen is a great achievement of European integration. As Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra said – and as I have repeatedly said many times in this Chamber – we need a unified Schengen, which should include Bulgaria and Romania and, soon, Croatia too. In order to ensure that the Schengen area of free movement is sustainable and secure, it is essential that we manage, protect and secure our external borders effectively and that we have full knowledge of who is coming in. It is in this spirit that we have proposed the Entry/Exit System. Its overall objectives are to improve the management of external borders, to prevent irregular migration and to facilitate the management of migration flows. It will enhance cooperation and facilitate information exchange between our Member States. I would like to express my thanks to Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra and the shadow rapporteurs for their hard work and for the agreement reached with the Council. This new instrument will bring several urgently needed improvements. First of all, it will enable us to monitor better the rules on short stays. The Entry/Exit System will calculate the duration of third country nationals’ authorisation for short stays in the European Union. It will alert border officials if a third country national is about to exceed 90 days in any 100-day period – for example, if someone makes several trips to the European Union. The Entry/Exit System will also check that the duration of the stay corresponds to the visa issued. Second, the Entry/Exit System will reduce the time needed to cross the border and will reduce the workload of border guards. The Entry/Exit System will allow Member States to automate most data and information—capturing steps as well as data verifications. Visitors to the European Union will benefit from process accelerators and self-service systems. For the border guards it will mean more time to focus on the most important parts of the border-check assessments. That is also why the Schengen Borders Code had to be amended. In addition, Member States may also create national facilitation programmes on a voluntary basis to further facilitate border crossings of pre—vetted frequent travellers. The compromise proposed describes the conditions these programmes must meet.  Third, as the Entry/Exit System will record travel document identity data, including biometrics, this will improve the detection of document and identity fraud and therefore increase security. Fourth, this system will support the competent authorities in combating terrorism and serious crimes. When necessary, these authorities will be able to access data in the system if all strict conditions are met. Lastly, the provisions on data protection are aligned to the new data protection framework and to the rulings of the Court of Justice. The current text includes all the necessary data protection safeguards. The coming into force of the legislation will be timely, so we can rapidly start to develop the system and get it up and running by 2020 at the latest. I am looking forward to the debate and I thank the honourable Members for their continued constructive shaping of European legislation in the area of border management.","Madam President, our debate today, ahead of the vote, is inevitably on an important priority, for, as we all know, it is linked to Schengen.

Roberta Metsola,N/A,"The next item is the debate on the European Council and Commission statements on EU-Russia relations, European security and Russia’s military threat against Ukraine (2022/2518(RSP)).  Dear Colleagues, as announced at the beginning of this part-session, our agenda of this week is dominated by the situation in Ukraine.  Today, we are starting our day with the most pressing debate on EU-Russia relations, European security and Russia’s military threat against Ukraine amidst intense international diplomatic exchanges to de-escalate the situation.  I am pleased to welcome the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, who are with us to discuss the latest developments on the ground in the wider context of European security and EU-Russia relations. Welcome to the plenary. On behalf of the European Parliament, we have repeatedly expressed solidarity with the people of Ukraine as they continue to face the uncertainty of the past weeks and fear of Russian military aggression. What we are witnessing here is also a threat to peace in Europe. I want to recall that, in September last year, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that called for containing Russia’s influence in the EU and its Eastern Neighbourhood and, in December last year, we also adopted a resolution where we criticised the actions of the Russian authorities and underlined our preparedness to ‘agree swiftly on further joint action’, including sanctions.  Today, just after this debate, we will vote on granting EUR 1.2 billion of ‘macro—financial assistance to Ukraine’. I would like to thank the European Commission for this timely proposal to support Ukraine’s financial stability and resilience in the current difficult circumstances.  Also later today, the Conference of Presidents will discuss the declaration on the situation in Ukraine. I would like to stress that, while we urge for a de-escalation of the current tension between Ukraine and Russia, this Parliament stands ready to support swift, forceful and concrete action, in coordination with other European institutions. The Union’s unity and close cooperation with our partners are key for the European Union to play a strong role on the international stage and to contribute to peace and security. We would be interested to know how lessons learned from the current situation will also be reflected in the works on the future Strategic Compass for the EU. Finally, I would like to thank you, President Michel, President von den Leyen and High Representative Borrell, for your engagement in the intense consultation on identifying ways to address the situation at the EU’s eastern borders and your efforts to uphold fundamental principles of the existing European security architecture.  Without further delay, I would like to give the floor to President of the European Council, Charles Michel, for your statement.","The next item is the debate on the European Council and Commission statements on EU-Russia relations, European security and Russia’s military threat against Ukraine ).

Also later today, the Conference of Presidents will discuss the declaration on the situation in Ukraine. I would like to stress that, while we urge for a de-escalation of the current tension between Ukraine and Russia, this Parliament stands ready to support swift, forceful and concrete action, in coordination with other European institutions. The Union’s unity and close cooperation with our partners are key for the European Union to play a strong role on the international stage and to contribute to peace and security. We would be interested to know how lessons learned from the current situation will also be reflected in the works on the future Strategic Compass for the EU. Finally, I would like to thank you, President Michel, President von den Leyen and High Representative Borrell, for your engagement in the intense consultation on identifying ways to address the situation at the EU’s eastern borders and your efforts to uphold fundamental principles of the existing European security architecture. Without further delay, I would like to give the floor to President of the European Council, Charles Michel, for your statement.","The next item is the debate on the European Council and Commission statements on EU-Russia relations, European security and Russia’s military threat against Ukraine ). Dear Colleagues, as announced at the beginning of this part-session, our agenda of this week is dominated by the situation in Ukraine. Today, we are starting our day with the most pressing debate on EU-Russia relations, European security and Russia’s military threat against Ukraine amidst intense international diplomatic exchanges",European Security

José Manuel Fernandes ,PPE," In this time of severe economic crisis and sluggishness in the various sectors, compounded by difficulties in the public finances of the Member States, I believe that simplifying legislation and regulations should be a priority, so as to make operating conditions for businesses and institutions more efficient. Shipping is subjected to complex administrative procedures, even for ships sailing between two EU ports and which do not enter the ports of third countries, and this incurs charges and unnecessary costs. I therefore support measures to reduce bureaucracy which make the use of new technologies worthwhile and enhance the concept of the single European area, abolishing complex administrative procedures and ensuring further gains by reducing administrative burdens. This initiative to exempt intra-European maritime transportation of goods from red tape and streamline procedures in the ports of different Member States is crucial in promoting a European maritime transport area without barriers and in ensuring conditions for more attractive, efficient, economic and environmentally friendly transport services.","In this time of severe economic crisis and sluggishness in the various sectors, compounded by difficulties in the public finances of the Member States, I believe that simplifying legislation and regulations should be a priority, so as to make operating conditions for businesses and institutions more efficient.

Andreas Mölzer ,NI," Madam President, contrary to the view of those advocates of the EU who wear rose-tinted glasses, accession to the Union alone is not enough to resolve all conflicts just like that. Especially when it comes to the applicant state of Turkey, it can be seen that the EU operates a double standard. Serbia, after all, is ready to engage in talks with Kosovo even though the EU’s attitude is manifestly inconsistent: in Bosnia, multiple ethnic groups are to be forced into a multicultural State while in Kosovo, it is deemed legitimate for a single ethnic group to hive itself off from a State. Not only has Serbia expressed its willingness to talk to Kosovo, but it has also apologised for the genocide at Srebrenica. Yet, despite this, Belgrade continues to be accused of failing to adequately cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. The violations of human rights in Turkey, however, where simply discussing the Armenian genocide is enough to merit punishment, are apparently something that can be overlooked. The accusation against Kosovar Prime Minister Thaçi of trading in human organs also demonstrates that war crimes cannot be viewed in a one-sided way. These accusations must be fully resolved. For accession to the EU, it is very important that Serbia and Kosovo first resolve their disputes.","Madam President, contrary to the view of those advocates of the EU who wear rose-tinted glasses, accession to the Union alone is not enough to resolve all conflicts just like that.

Mick Wallace,GUE/NGL," – Mr President, the two-state solution has been used as a smokescreen to fake concern for the human rights of Palestinians, while leaving the Israelis to pursue their genocidal treatment of the Palestinian people. The terms of the two-state solution are beyond anything the Israeli settler colonialists would ever entertain, and everyone knows it. Who is going to make them respect the 1967 lines? No one lifted a finger while they evicted Palestinians from their homes and lands, illegally annexed territory and built countless illegal settlements. Why should Palestinians accept the terms of a deal that they know from bitter experience the other side is incapable of honouring?  Three decades we have talked about this proposal as it becomes more of a fantasy, while the Palestinians suffered a brutal, grinding reality of apartheid. If this is all we have to offer, then the Palestinians are better off pursuing their right to resist the colonisation of their lands, to fight for self-determination, independence and the right of return for all Palestinian refugees to fight for human rights and freedom.","– Mr President, the two-state solution has been used as a smokescreen to fake concern for the human rights of Palestinians, while leaving the Israelis to pursue their genocidal treatment of the Palestinian people.

Probably the first copyright case in the history of the world took place in Ireland 1 500 years ago, when a monk called Finian invited another monk called Columcille to his monastery. Finian was writing a manuscript at the time. Columcille discovered it and got up each night to copy it. Finian was not pleased and he asked for it back. He did not get it back so he appealed to the High King. The High King heard the case and made a judgment, which was – I will say it in Irish first – do gach bó a lao, do gach leabhar a chóip, or ‘to every cow her calf, to every book its copy’. That is as relevant today as it was 1 500 years ago, because copyright and intellectual rights have to be guaranteed.

Maximilian Krah,ID,"im Namen der ID-Fraktion. – Herr Präsident, Herr Kommissar, meine Damen und Herren! Handel ist der wesentliche Schlüssel, um in der ganzen Welt Wohlstand und Frieden zu erreichen. Die Europäische Union ist entstanden aus der Europäischen Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft, um eben einen großen Handelsblock zu bilden, und wir sind heute der größte Handelsblock der Welt. Das ist etwas, was zwingend vergemeinschaftet gehört, und es ist eine Erfolgsgeschichte. Die Fragen, die wir hier heute behandeln, spiegeln aber genau die Zwiespältigkeit wider, dass wir einerseits den Handel fördern wollen, andererseits aber anfangen, diesen Handel auch sehr stark zu politisieren – mit negativen Folgen sowohl für den Handel als auch für die Handelspartner. Das beginnt leider bereits mit der allerersten Frage, wo es eben um Sanktionen geht. Das ist eine erstaunliche Schwerpunktsetzung, und es mag zwar sein, dass es Sanktionen geben muss, aber wenn dies schon als erste Frage gestellt wird, dann zeigt es, dass sich der Schwerpunkt unserer Handelspolitik von der Ermöglichung von Handel weg hin zu Regeln zur Durchsetzung politischer Vorgaben gewandelt hat. Und hier haben wir unsere Probleme.  Denn wie ist es denn? Wir alle wollen Entwicklung, wir wollen nachhaltige Entwicklung und das weltweit. Aber diese nachhaltige Entwicklung ist doch in beiderseitigem Interesse für alle Handelspartner, sodass es in der Regel nicht darauf ankommen wird, sofort mit Sanktionen zu drohen, sondern dass dies auf Gegenseitigkeit beruht. Wenn wir anfangen müssen, Sanktionen durchzusetzen, stellt sich doch die Frage, ob die Vorgaben von nachhaltiger Entwicklung, die wir stellen, wirklich für alle so überzeugend sind oder ob hier nicht eine neue Form des Eurozentrismus Raum greift, dass wir unseren in der Regel ärmeren und schwächeren Handelspartnern politische Vorgaben aus Europa machen, ohne dass die diese inhaltlich mittragen, und dass sie dann durch Sanktionen dazu gezwungen werden müssen. Insofern meinen wir: Jawohl, wir wollen Handel, wir wollen nachhaltige Entwicklung, aber wir müssen aufpassen, dass wir nicht übers Ziel hinausschießen und dass wir den Handel missbrauchen zu einer neuen Form eines Neokolonialismus, der letztlich uns und unseren Handelspartnern schadet.","im Namen der ID-Fraktion. – Herr Präsident, Herr Kommissar, meine Damen und Herren!

A lot of sustainable energy potential in Africa is still untapped. This represents a unique opportunity to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for Africa and Europe. Solar panels have a very high yield in Africa. If we cooperate more, both Africa and the rest of the world can benefit tremendously from their capacity for renewable energy.

State mentendo ai pescatori! È un'operazione di distrazione dalle responsabilità dei governi nazionali, come quello italiano. Questo piano chiede agli Stati membri il rispetto di direttive europee del 2020 e del 1992, quella sull'Habitat e quella sul quadro sull'ambiente marino. In Italia i pescatori già ora non pescano nelle aree marine protette e non fanno lo strascico, già ora non pescano nei siti Natura 2000 a protezione dei fondali. Piuttosto, dov'è il piano di gestione degli spazi marittimi per fermare le nuove trivellazioni? Perché se è vero che non sono soltanto i pescatori i responsabili della difesa degli ecosistemi marini, è anche vero che dobbiamo quindi fermare le fonti fossili. Siate quindi coerenti! Dove sono i bandi FEAMP per dare punti di sbarco legali e mercati ittici ai pescatori? Dove sono i soldi per ammodernare le loro imbarcazioni e per decarbonizzarle?

Claude Moraes,S&D,"on behalf of the S&D Group. – Madam President, the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean, where lives are lost and the European values that we speak about are being challenged every day, requires us to act. I think the chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) has had a very difficult task in trying to bring together Members of this House on this Resolution. But essentially, what he has done is to address both the Commission and the Member States on some key points, because it is quite concrete in the end: either we do something or we don’t. And we are doing this at the beginning of the new Commission, as the Commissioner said. So let’s be very clear: we can get around some of these things that would show our humanitarian effort and understand that we have some values here in the Mediterranean. We repeatedly called on the Commission to issue guidelines specifying which forms of facilitation should not be criminalised. In our Resolution, we call on the Commission to finally adopt those guidelines by the end of this year. I know the new Commission will only take office at the beginning of December, but the Asylum Package is frozen, as has been said. But there is a lot of work to be done to take this proactive approach. Operationally, we need more information and transparency on Frontex’s activities at sea, as well as on the funds and material support that are provided by the EU and its Member States to the border and coast guards in third countries, including Libya, Turkey, Egypt and Morocco. Fundamental rights, the principle of non-refoulement and the principle of disembarkation in a place of safety have to be respected. Finally, Member States should step up their moral and legal obligations to save lives at sea and adopt a proactive approach to search and rescue, making use of all available vessels, and to cooperate and support NGOs in their efforts. Essentially, the Resolution addresses, on the one hand, what the Commission can do and what the new Commission can do, and then the Member States, because for the Member States, this blame game, which is simply not demonstrating our values but passing around the blame, will continue to drain our resources, but ultimately it will require us to make difficult decisions: difficult decisions which ultimately will be the right moral decisions in the Mediterranean, but also sustainable decisions and proactive ones. This resolution should be supported. My Group is asking for the maximum amount of support to show that we have the European values that we want to demonstrate in the Mediterranean, and I hope it gains maximum support.","on behalf of the S&D Group. – Madam President, the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean, where lives are lost and the European values that we speak about are being challenged every day, requires us to act.

Georgios Stavrakakis ,S&D," Madam President, first of all I would like to thank President Caldeira for his presentation of the annual report by the Court of Auditors for 2011. In the context of the current economic and financial crisis, pressure on public finances is now even greater and, consequently, the effective use of public money is more important than ever. According to the information in the report by the Court of Auditors, the combined error rate for regional policy in transport, energy, employment and social affairs decreased significantly in comparison with 2010, from 7.7 % to 5.1 %. We must ensure that the European Union’s money is spent more effectively; this does not call for spending cuts, but better control. The national authorities must commit themselves to better management of the European Union’s funds, given that according to the Court of Auditors, more than 60 % of the errors noted in the course of implementation of regional policy could have been identified by the Member States if appropriate audits had been carried out.","Madam President, first of all I would like to thank President Caldeira for his presentation of the annual report by the Court of Auditors for 2011.

Gabriele Zimmer,GUE/NGL,"Herr Präsident! Ich gebe meiner Kollegin recht. Es geht nicht nur darum, dass Griechenland, Italien und die westlichen Balkanländer für die entstandene Situation verantwortlich sind, sondern wir selbst stehen insgesamt als Europäische Union – einschließlich der Mitgliedsstaaten einschließlich der Kommission, einschließlich uns, die wir politische Verantwortung hier im Europäischen Parlament haben – in der Pflicht, zu verhindern, dass sich Ereignisse wie im vergangenen Jahr wiederholen. Das, denke ich, sollte uns alle miteinander verbinden und sollte nicht dazu führen, dass wir irgendwie die Schuld auf irgendjemanden schieben, sondern dass wir ganz klar sagen, was jetzt zu tun ist. Da muss als Erstes gesagt werden: Wir haben ein Problem damit, dass es bei der Umsetzung dessen, was als Deals, als Abkommen zwischen der EU und anderen Ländern geschlossen worden ist, hapert, dass wir inzwischen eine Situation haben, dass zum Beispiel die griechischen Inseln durchaus auch seitens der EU – sicher nicht mit blanker Absicht, aber dennoch wird es zugelassen – so behandelt werden wie beispielsweise Australien, Papua-Neuguinea, als Insel betrachtet, um dort letztendlich das Flüchtlingsproblem abzuladen. Das können wir nicht mehr weiter zulassen. Es ist viel über die Kommission finanziert worden. Wir wissen aber auch, dass beispielsweise ein Großteil der Gelder gar nicht direkt an den griechischen Staat gehen kann, sondern an Flüchtlingsinitiativen oder an das UNHCR. Wir wissen auch, dass ein Teil dessen, wozu man sich verpflichtet hat, letztendlich gar nicht umgesetzt werden konnte. Auf den griechischen Inseln sollten 2 000 Wohnungen geschaffen werden. Die sind nicht geschaffen worden, es sind nur 1 100! Bei den Verpflichtungen, die auf dem Festland eingegangen worden sind, hapert es ebenfalls. 28 000 Plätze in Wohnungen sollten vom UNHCR geschaffen werden. Es fehlen noch 9 000. Dafür sind die Gelder schon vorhanden, sie sind bereitgestellt worden! Die griechische Regierung war verpflichtet, permanente Einrichtungen mit 12 000 Plätzen zu schaffen. Sie hat das Ziel so gut wie erreicht: da fehlen, glaube ich, noch 200 Plätze. Wir sollten wirklich daran gehen, dass wir sagen: Wir brauchen konkrete praktische Lösungen. Es gibt einen Vorschlag, beispielsweise Hotelzimmer anzumieten. Jetzt sagen aber die Regeln – sowohl seitens des UNHCR, aber auch für die Kommission: Das geht nicht. Wir können keine Hotelzimmer finanzieren. Doch! Wir müssen eine Lösung finden! Denn die Wohnungen werden nicht so schnell kommen. Mir kann keiner erzählen, dass man beispielsweise einen Hotspot wie in Moria, der permanent überbelegt ist – statt 2 500 sind 5 000 bis 6 000 Flüchtlinge dort – winterfest machen kann. Das geht nicht! Wenn ich auf den Inseln aber auch die Wohnungen nicht schaffen kann, dann muss ich wirklich gucken, wie ich nutze, dass es dort ein Potenzial an freien Zimmern gibt, die angemietet werden können, und dann muss ich die Regeln verändern! Dazu muss es doch einen Weg geben, das ist doch eine praktische Lösung! Also: Neben dem, was schon gemacht worden ist, muss mehr gemacht werden. Zweitens möchte ich darauf hinweisen: Das Problem verstärkt sich ja auch gerade dadurch, dass die vielen Mitgliedstaaten ihre Regeln nicht einhalten. Ich habe gestern im deutschen Fernsehen einen kurzen Bericht gesehen. Gezeigt wurden da mehrere Flüchtlinge im Hungerstreik wegen der Bedingungen im Lager. Inzwischen habe ich festgestellt: Die waren im Hungerstreik – Gott sei Dank haben sie ihn jetzt beendet –, weil sie nach Deutschland sollen und von Deutschland nicht aufgenommen werden. Das deutsche Fernsehen sagt das aber nicht. Es erweckt den Eindruck: Das sind wieder die Griechen, die sind zu allem zu blöd, die kriegen es nicht hin. Aber wir als Bundesrepublik Deutschland erfüllen unsere Pflichten nicht. Und so betrifft das auch viele andere Länder. Das ist der Punkt, da bitte ich auch den Rat anzusetzen und zu sagen: Lassen Sie uns nicht über allgemeine Dinge reden, sondern lassen Sie uns konkret werden. Es geht um Menschenleben. Hier stehen wir alle gemeinsam in der Verantwortung.","Herr Präsident! Ich gebe meiner Kollegin recht. Es geht nicht nur darum, dass Griechenland, Italien und die westlichen Balkanländer für die entstandene Situation verantwortlich sind, sondern wir selbst stehen insgesamt als Europäische Union – einschließlich der Mitgliedsstaaten einschließlich der Kommission, einschließlich uns, die wir politische Verantwortung hier im Europäischen Parlament haben – in der Pflicht, zu verhindern, dass sich Ereignisse wie im vergangenen Jahr wiederholen. Das, denke ich, sollte uns alle miteinander verbinden und sollte nicht dazu führen, dass wir irgendwie die Schuld auf irgendjemanden schieben, sondern dass wir ganz klar sagen, was jetzt zu tun ist. Da muss als Erstes gesagt werden: Wir haben ein Problem damit, dass es bei der Umsetzung dessen, was als Deals, als Abkommen zwischen der EU und anderen Ländern geschlossen worden ist, hapert, dass wir inzwischen eine Situation haben, dass zum Beispiel die griechischen Inseln durchaus auch seitens der EU – sicher nicht mit blanker Absicht, aber dennoch wird es zugelassen – so behandelt werden wie beispielsweise Australien, Papua-Neuguinea, als Insel betrachtet, um dort letztendlich das Flüchtlingsproblem abzuladen. Das können wir nicht mehr weiter zulassen. Es ist viel über die Kommission finanziert worden. Wir wissen aber auch, dass beispielsweise ein Großteil der Gelder gar nicht direkt an den griechischen Staat gehen kann, sondern an Flüchtlingsinitiativen oder an das UNHCR. Wir wissen auch, dass ein Teil dessen, wozu man sich verpflichtet hat, letztendlich gar nicht umgesetzt werden konnte. Auf den griechischen Inseln sollten 2 000 Wohnungen geschaffen werden. Die sind nicht geschaffen worden, es sind nur 1 100! Bei den Verpflichtungen, die auf dem Festland eingegangen worden sind, hapert es ebenfalls. 28 000 Plätze in Wohnungen sollten vom UNHCR geschaffen werden. Es fehlen noch 9 000. Dafür sind die Gelder schon vorhanden, sie sind bereitgestellt worden! Die griechische Regierung war verpflichtet, permanente Einrichtungen mit 12 000 Plätzen zu schaffen. Sie hat das Ziel so gut wie erreicht: da fehlen, glaube ich, noch 200 Plätze. Wir sollten wirklich daran gehen, dass wir sagen: Wir brauchen konkrete praktische Lösungen.

Treba jasno reći da je na početku pandemije bilo grešaka te osuditi ponašanje pojedinih država koje su uvele ograničenja na izvoz medicinske opreme u druge države članice kada im je ona bila najpotrebnija. Upravo to nam pokazuje koliko je potreban zajednički europski odgovor na buduće zdravstvene krize. Države članice, posebno one manje koje nemaju vlastitu farmaceutsku industriju, ne mogu se samostalno boriti protiv pandemije ovakvih razmjera, bez zajedničke nabave cjepiva i medicinske opreme.

Na taj je način još jednom dokazano koliko je europska solidarnost važna.  Svi građani EU-a moraju imati jednaku zaštitu od svih zdravstvenih prijetnji te pristup istoj skrbi i liječenju bez obzira na zemlju u kojoj žive. Iskustvo pandemije pokazalo nam je da je ključno: osigurati praćenje, znanstvenu analizu i koordinaciju djelovanja država članica, imati u rezervi i pravedno distribuirati medicinske protumjere te osigurati slobodu kretanja ključnih proizvoda u vrijeme krize, kao i omogućiti kvalitetnije i otpornije zdravstvene sustave.  Moramo nastaviti graditi snažnu europsku zdravstvenu uniju u kojoj se sve države članice međusobno koordiniraju, pripremaju zajedno, odgovaraju na ovu i buduće javno zdravstvene krize.","u ime kluba PPE. – Poštovani predsjedavajući, povjereniče, kolegice i kolege, pandemija covid- 19 je osim javnozdravstvene ugroze neviđenih razmjera, pokazala i svu krhkost zdravstvenih sustava država članica, uzrokovala lančano zatvaranje granica te pad gospodarskih aktivnosti u Europskoj uniji.

Taking into account the fact that the Latvian Parliament and ruling coalition contain the pro-Nazi political forces of Latvia, there is nothing new in the statement of Parliament’s Speaker. But for the first time in the history of modern Latvia it is precisely the Speaker of the Saeima who so cynically neglects the opinion of European Union. Last year already, when Knut Vollebæk, the OSCE High Commissioner, mistakenly praised the Latvian Government for ‘successes’ in the integration, the Speaker of the Parliament, Mrs Aboltina, and the Prime Minister of Latvia, Mr Dombrovskis, admired him. Today, when Vollebæk ‘has had his eyes opened’ on the situation in Latvia, his recommendations are not needed. All that gives the right to assert that the Latvian Republic lives by double standards, supporting legislation where features of nationalism and racism are openly displayed! It is necessary to evaluate the statements and actions of members of the ruling coalitions and the Prime Minister of the Latvian Republic, which are leading to national conflict.

Robert Rochefort ,ALDE," Because of their characteristics, mountain areas face specific challenges including, in particular, a rapidly ageing population, transport difficulties, obstacles to energy supply and a lack of regional integration. As a representative of France’s South-West constituency in the European Parliament, and being particularly sensitive to the problems faced by areas in the Pyrenees, I voted for the resolution on the European strategy for economic and social development of mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas. In particular, the text calls for the establishment of a specific European policy framework to deal with the problems that these areas face in order to enable them to better overcome the permanent disadvantages and to adapt their development model by making the most of all their assets. It also calls for better coordination of the four structural funds, the Cohesion Fund and the other European financial instruments in order to maximise their effectiveness and thus facilitate the economic development of these areas. I support these objectives.","Because of their characteristics, mountain areas face specific challenges including, in particular, a rapidly ageing population, transport difficulties, obstacles to energy supply and a lack of regional integration.

To stem this migration, the EU was willing to bend over backwards and ignore the war on the Kurds, the smuggling of oil from ISIS and the continual destruction of human rights in Turkey. Instead of dealing with the real issues of the Schengen zone and Ms Merkel’s insane open doors policy, the EU is choosing to believe that a coup was attempted, when in reality it was set up by the Turkish Government to crack down on internal dissent. I am only glad that we in the UK are getting out of the EU while we can, because this policy is madness.

According to the Council, the conclusion of accession negotiations with Croatia is within reach, but we know from the Commission that corruption issues and judicial reform have not yet been properly dealt with. This is very serious. Our concerns are not artificial. Croatia, with a population of 4.5 million, apparently suffers from nearly a million backlogged court cases, with a significant number of cases connected to the abuse of property rights. Media freedom is also under assault. Former ministers have been charged with corruption. Some might see this as evidence of action. Actually it reveals the depth of a malaise that has hardly been addressed. Widespread corruption among politicians and the judiciary has meant a failure to tackle organised crime directly connected to the Balkan route.

This is an aspect that should be firmly taken into account in all our cooperation, especially when they are set up, and as it happened with the Israeli police force, including on cybercrimes, to ensure adequate controls and conditionalities, because the use of such spyware to silence dissidents and stifle free speech is a threat to democracy and must be firmly condemned.

Diane Dodds ,NI,"Mr President, for me and my constituents in Northern Ireland, the fishing industry and 27 years of the common fisheries policy is summed up in paragraph 138 of this report which reiterates that one of the few areas in which the CFP has been relatively successful is where Member States have had control. The ideal for us would be the scrapping of the CFP or the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from it, thus allowing Member States to take back control of their waters. Regretfully, we are not living in this ideal world. The reform of the CFP will inevitably result in another second best for Northern Ireland’s fishermen, a second best that has, for the past three decades, been marked by an unjustified decline of our fishing industry, and unanswered questions surrounding the state of those fish stocks on which our industry depends. And this was absolutely demonstrated by the debacle around the December Fishing Council and the decisions on quotas. Whilst it is very much a second best, I strongly support the regionalisation of the CFP as set out by the rapporteur. I support the view that the CFP should be based on three core principles of environmental, social and economic dimensions. And my most honest hope is that we can deliver a policy that will reverse the disastrous consequences of the CFP. However, I fear that radical change promised by some in this review will result in another lost opportunity for our fishing industry and our fish stocks.","Mr President, for me and my constituents in Northern Ireland, the fishing industry and 27 years of the common fisheries policy is summed up in paragraph 138 of this report which reiterates that one of the few areas in which the CFP has been relatively successful is where Member States have had control. The ideal for us would be the scrapping of the CFP or the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from it, thus allowing Member States to take back control of their waters. Regretfully, we are not living in this ideal world. The reform of the CFP will inevitably result in another second best for Northern Ireland’s fishermen, a second best that has, for the past three decades, been marked by an unjustified decline of our fishing industry, and unanswered questions surrounding the state of those fish stocks on which our industry depends. And this was absolutely demonstrated by the debacle around the December Fishing Council and the decisions on quotas. Whilst it is very much a second best, I strongly support the regionalisation of the CFP as set out by the rapporteur.

Detta är inte den första provokationen, utan den väcker oroande minnen. För snart åtta år sedan slutade en liknande upptrappning med den illegala och folkrättsvidriga annekteringen av Krimhalvön. Enligt Helsingforsavtalet har länder rätt till självbestämmande, och konflikter kring gränser ska lösas med diplomati. Trots det har Ryssland tidigare inte tvekat att kränka andra länders suveränitet och ändra gränser med militärmakt, och de verkar nu vara villiga att göra det igen. Agerandet är ett angrepp på Helsingforsavtalet, och det är i strid med den europeiska säkerhetsordningen.

László Andor,N/A," Mr Tabajdi, the Commission’s proposal was indeed preceded by a very detailed impact analysis, which indicated that the new legislation to be adopted would help boost the number of employees who could find employment through such posting. This, however, is obviously not a goal in itself. That is, it is not a goal to have more workers employed abroad as opposed to their home environments, but these opportunities must be exploited. If we compare the European Union to, say, the United States, another single market, we find that mobility here in Europe is much more modest. This, however, has a multitude of reasons, just as there is a multitude of reasons in the case of posting, and also in respect of the free movement of workers in general. The international movement of labour, whether in the form of free employment or posting, is impeded by linguistic and administrative barriers, housing situations, differences in the ease of finding accommodation, and a variety of other factors. We seek to eliminate these barriers, to ensure that there are as few of them as possible, because this is not just a right of freedom for European citizens, but also a critical economic opportunity for both the business sector and private individuals.","Mr Tabajdi, the Commission’s proposal was indeed preceded by a very detailed impact analysis, which indicated that the new legislation to be adopted would help boost the number of employees who could find employment through such posting.

Frédérique Ries ,ALDE," I voted for the excellent report by my colleague Sylvie Goulard on budgetary surveillance in the euro area. It is a crucial component of the legislative package on reforming economic governance, known as the ‘six-pack’ in European jargon. The report’s key proposal is worded as follows: ‘Member States whose currency is the euro should pool up to [...] per cent of the sovereign debt under joint and several liabilities (Eurosecurities).’ This key idea has been advocated for months by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and calls for the creation of Eurobonds, in other words a pooling of the debt and the ability for countries currently undergoing austerity to borrow at reasonable rates on the markets. Of course, pooling the debt will not get rid of it. It goes without saying that Greece, like the other countries at risk, must first start stabilising their public finances. However, beyond the Member States having to bear reduced financial costs, the greatest strength of Eurobonds certainly lies in promoting the euro as a safe-haven currency. This is a credible alternative to the dollar since 25% of Chinese foreign exchange reserves are already in the European currency.","I voted for the excellent report by my colleague Sylvie Goulard on budgetary surveillance in the euro area.

Janusz Lewandowski,N/A,"Madam President, I should like to thank the Members for their comments. I have three short remarks: the first on the crisis derogation. Fortunately the misunderstanding was clarified. Yes, the Commission wanted an extension until the end of 2013, but this was voted down by a blocking minority, including some states which benefited from the scheme. There were good reasons for extending the scheme due to the developments in the labour market, with a sudden recent acceleration of applications – two thirds of all the applications came in 2010 and 2011. I can agree with Ms Ţicǎu that countries in Eastern Europe undergoing the so-called transformation from the old system to the new system know how painful this might be without globalisation, as our countries can neither be termed developed or under-developed parts of the world; this was rather a mis-developed part of the world, with a lot of industrial stock on the ground but completely useless in terms of a market economy. My second remark concerns Renault. Thank you, Mr Gauzès, for explaining the action from the local point of view. I can only say that I know a special unit has been set up by Renault to deal with the issue. Our prerogative is to monitor and contact, but I can assure all of you that, from the legal point of view, this case fulfilled all the criteria of the European Globalisation Fund application. What matters is the future: as the Globalisation Fund is on the table in the proposal for 2014-2020, this means that we fully understand the added value of the fund in terms of making the reactions of the Member States more durable and of improved quality in terms of active labour market policy. What is clear from the mid-term review is that exactly 42% of the workers covered by the scheme under this crisis derogation were able very quickly to find places on the job market. So this is working and is probably very conducive to the reintegration of redundant workers into the labour market. I agree fully with those who ask for a much quicker response by the Globalisation Fund. This is as slow as the Solidarity Fund, which is also part of the proposal. What was very controversial – and here the remarks of Mr Daerden and Ms Cornelissen are relevant – is whether to extend it to farming. This was done in a very clear context, and the context, as I can reveal, was going into the Mercosur trade liberalisation talks with insecurity in the rural areas around the impact of trade liberalisation on the farming community. For my colleagues, and especially the one responsible for this major deal on trade liberalisation, this was a kind of insurance cover for entering into the trade liberalisation agreements with countries with more competitive pricing for agricultural products. This was the context of the decision to risk the extension of the Globalisation Fund to farming. But this is not at the cost of industrial workers, because we have our estimates in the pipeline, and I think the numbers proposed could be adequate as insurance for both areas: industry and farming. But I can agree with Mr Alvaro and the others that this is keine Wunderwaffe: this is one of the tools in the toolbox for dealing with a crisis: valuable, therefore extended and should be defended, because this is also a tangible and visible sign in several corners of the European Union that the European institutions are useful, credible and could help.","Madam President, I should like to thank the Members for their comments.

José Manuel Fernandes ,PPE," In March 2000 in Lisbon, and March 2002 in Barcelona, the European Council approved the strategic objective of making the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, making its education and training systems a global benchmark in terms of quality, and creating the European Area of Research and Innovation. The Member States are responsible for education and training policies, while the role of the EU is to support the improvement of national systems through new instruments at EU level, mutual learning and the exchange of information and best practice. The knowledge-based economy and rapid technological development present challenges to higher education and research in Europe, but they also open up new opportunities which must be effectively harnessed. In this context, creating quality partnerships in higher education and business is of the utmost importance. I believe that cooperation between the education sector and business at local, regional, national and transnational level is crucial for bridging the gap between the supply logic of the education sector and the demand logic of the world of employment.","In March 2000 in Lisbon, and March 2002 in Barcelona, the European Council approved the strategic objective of making the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, making its education and training systems a global benchmark in terms of quality, and creating the European Area of Research and Innovation. The Member States are responsible for education and training policies, while the role of the EU is to support the improvement of national systems through new instruments at EU level, mutual learning and the exchange of information and best practice. The knowledge-based economy and rapid technological development present challenges to higher education and research in Europe, but they also open up new opportunities which must be effectively harnessed.

Tineke Strik,Greens/EFA," – Madam President, I’m very happy with all the criticism over the Hungarian developments, which are very concerning. But the EU Council also decided to consolidate the EU Turkey statement with new funding. And only the previous part-session, Parliament adopted the resolution with clear demands on migration deals. We must ensure human rights compliance, which requires impact assessments and independent monitoring, democratic and judicial control, and scrutiny of the use of funds.  The EU Turkey statement doesn’t meet any of these criteria. So how do we monitor the situation of refugees? Is it taken into account that non-Syrian asylum seekers lack access to an asylum procedure? Will the funding of border controls result in a complete closure of the southern-east borders where refugees tried to escape violence?  There are strong indications that forced returns to Syria are being made and that UNHCR doesn’t have access to any removal centre. Let me be clear: we must support the refugees in Turkey. Many of them are in precarious circumstances, and Turkey takes a large share but the conditions on border control and readmission have a human rights impact, and we must ensure that we support human rights that affect them in our external action.

Bart Groothuis,ALDE," – Mr President, dear Commissioner, it makes perfect sense that some EU Member States use commercial spyware to fulfil legitimate law enforcement requirements.  That’s not the problem. The real problem, of course, is, like the rapporteur said, that some EU Member States use this spyware to discredit the democratic opposition and kill democracy in Europe. Poland, Hungary, Greece – shame on them.  And I have a triple call to action to the Commission. First, since it is often the Israeli Government signing export licences for the spyware used to kill democracy in Europe, the EU should exert significant pressure on Jerusalem to halt such exports.  Secondly, together with our American friends, the EU should put forward primary and secondary sanctions to entities who sell to the rule of law violators. Put these companies out of business.  And, last but not least, let me remind the Commissioner that it was the brilliant Canadian NGO Citizens Lab who disclosed the Pegasus spyware scandal here in Europe in the first place. Where, dear Commissioner, is the European equivalent to investigate such technical operations? My amendment to the European budget has already created a budget line to create such an institution. It’s now up to you to follow up and make it happen.

Tineke Strik,Greens/EFA," – Madam President, at sea every minute counts. It’s hard to imagine that we would leave EU citizens in danger of drowning, floating in a rubber dinghy without any help. Yet this is what we do with migrants on a daily basis. But international maritime law obliges also the EU, as a party to the UNCLOS Treaty, to take responsibility for an adequate search and rescue. That requires sufficient capacity in the Mediterranean Sea, rapid coordination of the rescue, and disembarkation to a place of safety. As Libya is not safe, we cannot fund and organise their return to Tripoli without violating international law. What we should do instead is help migrants escape from this hell. This requires all Member States to take their responsibility and humanitarian assistance to be supported instead of criminalised. I urge the Commission to base its new arrangements on these principles, make it permanent, and make it swift. But please ensure saving lives and disembarkation in the meantime, as every minute counts.","– Madam President, at sea every minute counts.

June Alison Mummery,NI," – Mr President, while the upcoming UN biodiversity conference aims to build a common future for all life on Earth, when it comes to Britain’s seas, the EU’s attitude is little more than take, take, take. Just look at the vast amounts of biodiversity killed in British waters by Dutch electric pole fishing – a method banned by the Chinese for being too efficient. Or the super trawlers working in the Channel – gigantic factory ships which scoop of whole shoals of fish together with anything else in the area, such as the under strain sea bass and highly intelligent dolphins. These death trawlers are blamed for nearly wiping out whole fisheries in East Africa and destroying the incomes of some of the poorest people. These are only two small examples of the EU putting profit before biodiversity.  Until the EU takes action to stop practices which threaten the environment of its backyard, it has no right to lecture anyone else. The fact is, actions speak louder the words and the people are watching.

Kader Arif ,S&D," Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, trade policy is going to be a major factor in the Union’s external policy. Unfortunately, this trade policy is today the symbol of the disappearance of Community interest, since it is nothing other than the addition of national interests. At a time when we want Europe to defend its values – solidarity, social justice – when we want Europe to be able to integrate into its trade agreements social rights, environmental rights, the protection of human rights and the protection of trade union rights, we realise that the Commission’s only proposal to us is to conclude agreements in which it is felt that there is no alternative to the market and trade and that they are an end in themselves. This, as far as my political family is concerned, is unacceptable. At a time when we want this trade policy to be able to integrate industrial policy and the effects that it may have on employment policies, we realise that the Commission has given no guarantees on these points in the comments made this morning by the President of the Commission. Unfortunately, however, this does not surprise me. Nothing has been said about the horizontal social clause, about the protection of public services, about the way to see Europe change policy again or have a totally different policy. To conclude my remarks on these issues, Mr Barroso, I believe that trust is built within a two-way relationship. With your comments this morning, you have not offered us what we need to put our trust in you. Please note that, since you have not provided these guarantees, I cannot guarantee that we will put our trust in you.","Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, trade policy is going to be a major factor in the Union’s external policy.

Bas Eickhout,N/A,"on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. – Madam President, and good morning to you all, we are discussing today a European citizens’ initiative that got more than 1 million verified signatures. And the title of that initiative is ‘Save the Bees’, where everyone is of course very much concerned about, but I think also very important: save the farmers. And for very sure, I know that we will have a discussion again about our farming model. But what the citizens are aiming for here also is, by changing our agricultural model, we can save the bees and the farmers at the same time. And for me that is always a pretty strange part of the discussion that I have here in this House. When we are discussing agriculture, I don’t meet anyone who is happy with the developments in our agriculture system. We see that young farmers are more and more reluctant to get into this business. We see that less and less farmers are there and that they’re getting bigger and bigger, but that the profits are shrinking. So no one is really happy with the current agriculture model. Doesn’t that mean we need a substantial change, a substantial change that benefits the farmer but also benefits our natural system, which our agriculture system is built upon? And that is exactly what this initiative is trying to put forward. And that’s also a call to the Commission to do now something about the change of our agriculture system. And of course, the Commission launched its Farm to Fork initiative, which, by the way, was very well supported by this House as well. But now the question is, what are we going to do with the Farm to Fork ambition? Yes, there is one file out, that is the sustainable use of pesticides. And you see already and probably some colleagues will mention that again, there is not full support for that proposal and some even want to get rid of it. That would mean there is nothing of the Farm to Fork strategy then on the table. Then what’s your plan? You will stick to business as usual with the model you’re not happy about. So something needs to change. And this is really a question to the Commission. What are you going to propose to change? Not strategies, not initiatives, not nice reports, but laws to change to make us less dependent on pesticides, fertilisers, antibiotics, because that’s the model that needs to change for the bees and the farmers.","on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. – Madam President, and good morning to you all, we are discussing today a European citizens’ initiative that got more than 1 million verified signatures.

Although Europe has been providing support for our most deprived citizens since 1987 by distributing food, without which many families would be unable to eat on some days, some Member States have disputed the mechanism, because in Europe, unfortunately, we are only able to make savings at the expense of the weak. So we are now heading straight for a food crisis for over 20 million Europeans. From a figure of EUR 500 million in 2011, the food distribution scheme will be cut to EUR 113 million in 2012. In the midst of the crisis, when the rich are getting even richer, when large corporate groups are inundating their shareholders with dividend payments, Europe will be sending a shocking message to the victims of the crisis. Those who are hungry do not care about stupid quarrels. Parliament has a duty to restore Europe’s political honour by somehow reversing this scandalous decision.","Madam President, this is a genuine scandal, a denial of justice.

Csaba Sándor Tabajdi ,S&D," Pollinating insects, in particular wild and domesticated honeybees, which are responsible for the pollination of 80% of European flowering plants, play a key role in maintaining biological diversity. The decline in bee populations experienced for years can be attributed to numerous causes, as I called attention to in my report adopted last year on ‘Honeybee health and the challenges of the beekeeping sector’. The lack of veterinary products, the excessive use of certain plant protection products and their active substances (in particular, those belonging to the neonicotinoid family), certain intensive agricultural production methods and the damaging effects of climate change all contribute to that decline. The greatest problem, however, is that there are insufficient EU funds for scientific research in the field of beekeeping and data collection at European level. Our knowledge of the European honeybee stock is incomplete, and scientific results allowing responsible decisions to be made are obtained with great difficulty. I therefore welcome the fact that the report, in line with my earlier report, calls on the Commission to increase significantly the support provided for the beekeeping sector. Honeybee health is in the interest of both European farmers and environmentalists, and serves the interests of both agribusiness and environmental protection. Honeybees generate public goods by means of pollination, which is why it is right for the new common agricultural policy coming into effect from 2014 to give the sector greater support than to date.","Pollinating insects, in particular wild and domesticated honeybees, which are responsible for the pollination of 80% of European flowering plants, play a key role in maintaining biological diversity.

We have seen the limitations of the method of coordination that you continue to advocate. What has been your response? It has been to bring together the ministers for economic affairs and finance of the euro area and the European Union a little more frequently and to give the Commission increased powers of control over national budgetary processes. You are nonetheless well aware of what ‘austere’ stuff the Commission is made. You have done all that by keeping national parliaments very largely out of the picture, and increasingly, the European Parliament as well. Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, what you are suggesting looks more and more like the Chinese model, a model which I think that we do not share. I hope that this is not the price to be paid for the loan that, through Mr Sarkozy and through Mr Regling, you are going to request from the Middle Kingdom.","Mr President, Presidents, what we need is a major step towards federalism.

Jytte Guteland,S&D," – Fru talman! Herr kommissionär! Den cirkulära ekonomin är grundläggande om vi i EU ska klara våra ambitioner vad gäller den gröna given, men också vårt mål att bli klimatneutrala senast 2050. Om vi ska klara omställningen till ett hållbarare samhälle måste vi lägga om hela kedjan, från produktion och konsumtion till avfall.  Om alla skulle konsumera på det vis vi gör i EU skulle vi behöva tre jordklot. Samtidigt som människor hungrar, svälter i delar av världen, konsumerar vi 90 miljoner ton matsvinn varje år, och mycket försvinner redan innan det hamnat på tallriken. Vi vet att vi har mikroplaster som går ut i våra hav och förgiftar våra ekosystem, och vi vet att klimatutsläppen är betydligt mer än vad Parisavtalet medger. Europa måste slå in på en utveckling där vi frikopplar vår ekonomiska tillväxt från resursanvändningen. Vi måste sluta kretsloppen. Vi måste bli smartare i hela vår resursanvändning.  Detta är också bra för jobben. Det här skulle kunna generera 700 000 nya jobb inom den cirkulära ekonomin till år 2030, och det här måste vi satsa på. Därför välkomnar vi handlingsplanen från kommissionen som mycket bra. Men vi vill konkretisera en del mål ytterligare. Jag vill också tacka Simona Bonafè som har gjort ett utmärkt arbete.","– Fru talman! Herr kommissionär!

Eija-Riitta Korhola ,PPE," Madam President, the EU’s intention to weed out illegal timber and timber products and prevent them from accessing our markets is excellent in terms of its purpose, and I therefore voted in favour of the regulation. Its implementation will leave a lot to be desired, however, and I wanted to mention that. The illegal harvesting of timber is an obvious bugbear for legal operators in the forest industry, and it must be eliminated. Countermeasures, however, need to be considered carefully, so as not to hamper the operations of those that follow the rules. We have to remember that most of the wood used in the EU comes legally from within the EU itself. The problems lie outside. It will therefore be frustrating if we design such stringent monitoring systems for ourselves that we weaken the competitiveness of the industry in the EU without being able to tackle the problem itself at the same time. The ban on placing illegally harvested wood on our markets sounds good but, in practice, it will puzzle actors in the industry. The requirements regarding traceability were formerly taken care of in the accounts, where the companies in the chain knew what they were buying and from whom, and to whom they were selling the goods. Now that these requirements are to be extended to cover the entire chain of operations, it will seem as if we are trying to act from within, even though the problem is rife elsewhere. Again, the EU will be tormenting itself, whereas it should be trying to improve the world.","Madam President, the EU’s intention to weed out illegal timber and timber products and prevent them from accessing our markets is excellent in terms of its purpose, and I therefore voted in favour of the regulation.

Hannah Neumann,Greens/EFA,"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, dear colleagues, it has been quite a struggle, but now we have the EU global human rights sanctions regime. And you may have realised, especially with regards to China, it has created some effect and some impact. So I think it’s good that we finally debated it here in the European Parliament because it was actually the Parliament that initiated this mechanism.  It is the Parliament that was mainly targeted by Chinese retaliation. And it’s the Parliament that we use to debate issues on human rights and EU foreign policy. So, Mr Logar, it may be the prerogative of the Council to decide on sanctions alone, but this is not how it should be. And this is part of our questions and our resolution as well, because at the moment we have an EU global human rights sanction regime where the European Parliament doesn’t have a say in it.  So I think it’s good that, as a start, we agreed across all political parties that it’s time to establish a dedicated working group looking at the implementation of sanction regimes and making proposals for possible persons or organisations to be sanctioned.  And I also call on the Council and Commission to reach out more strongly to civil society organisations, to journalists, to human rights defenders. They are our allies in the fight against human rights violations and I think they should also have a formal mechanism in which they can include their proposals, their ideas, their discussions into this mechanism, and not just random consultation whenever it pleases the Council and the Commission.  That’s the second call. I think that is very important in our resolution.  So after seven months of this mechanism, I think it’s good that we say congratulations, we have it and it has an impact. But I think now it’s time to join forces to make the best use of it. We here in the Parliament are ready. Civil society is ready and I have high trust in the Commission and the Council that they are equally willing to join forces with us to make the best use of this instrument.","on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, dear colleagues, it has been quite a struggle, but now we have the EU global human rights sanctions regime.

Paolo Gentiloni,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, this House is addressing the defining challenge of this century, of our generations and also of this Commission’s mandate. The agreements discussed today, together with the rest of the ‘Fit for 55’ package, will fully deliver on the climate law commitments and put the EU on track to become the first climate—neutral continent by 2050. They form an ambitious and coherent package, which will also give us the means to ensure a socially fair transition and make sure that no one will be left behind. The reinforced emissions trading system extended to the maritime sector will strengthen our domestic carbon pricing policy, helping us drive investments into decarbonisation, including for aviation. The separate ETS covering buildings and road transport will allow reducing emissions in high emitting sectors. The revenues from this separate ETS will fund the Social Climate Fund, which will help Member States addressing the social impact of the transition. The carbon border adjustment mechanism, by putting a fair price of carbon on imported products, will prevent that the EU increased ambition is undermined by carbon intensive goods produced outside the EU and incentivise our international partners to implement decarbonisation policies. I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Liese, Chahim, de Lange, Casa and Glavak for making these arrangements possible. And let me stress some key aspects of each arrangement.  Emissions trading is the centrepiece of European climate policy. We put a price on carbon. It will now be strengthened to reduce emissions by 62 % by 2030 compared with 2005, extended to maritime transport and the size and scope of its innovation and modernisation funds will be increased. As part of the compromise, the Commission agrees in a statement to implement a number of measures to further enhance the integrity and transparency of the European carbon market. And there is another key point of the European way of tackling climate change. We all know that while the poorest and most vulnerable people contribute the least to the crisis, they bear the brunt of climate change impacts. We have the responsibility of preventing the most vulnerable from being disproportionately impacted. This is why, with the reviewed ETS, Member States will spend the entirety of their ETS revenues on climate projects and to address social aspects of the transition. And the Commission has provided an explanatory statement on this. The EU carbon border adjustment mechanism will be a landmark tool to put a fair price, equal to the price paid by EU producers, on the carbon emitted during the production of carbon-intensive goods that are entering in the EU. The EU is the first jurisdiction in the world to put in place such a breakthrough climate measure at its borders. It is already having a positive impact globally, as a growing number of jurisdictions are considering putting a price on carbon. There must be no ambiguities. CBAM is a WTO-compliant climate instrument to support our increased green ambition in an efficient way. This product scope may be further extended in the future, based on a thorough analysis as part of a report that the Commission will prepare in 2025. We will continue to work with the industry and our international partners for a gradual and smooth implementation of CBAM. On ETS aviation, the agreement brings major advantages, including financial support for airlines using sustainable aviation fuels, a monitoring, reporting and verification system for non—CO2 emissions, and more transparency of emissions data for international flights.  The agreement is also historic for the shipping sector, which will be included under the ETS by 2024.  A new separate emission trading system covering road transport and buildings will start from 27. It could contribute to 45 % of the additional emission reductions compared to current policy in 2030. There will be a smooth and gradual start with safeguards for households in case prices exceed certain thresholds or if market liquidity is too low. For example, we will increase even further the predictability of the price development in cases that the average carbon price over a period of two consecutive months should exceed a level of EUR 45. We are confident that this and other safeguards, such as the initial injection of additional volumes into the market or the automatic triggers from the market stability reserve are relevant mechanisms to protect citizens while reducing fossil fuels allowances. And, of course, another key element is the Social Climate Fund. It will address the social impact of the transition on vulnerable households, transport users and micro—enterprises, in particular citizens in energy or transport poverty. It will mobilise EUR 86.7 billion between 26 and 32.  The Commission is making three statements on the Social Climate Fund. One concerns the deletion of the mandatory use of a single data—mining tool. Another one relates to the possibility to designate more than one authority to sign the management declaration. Last, there is a link between the Social Climate Fund and the Energy Efficiency Directive with regard to definition of energy poverty. President, honourable Members, if you support these proposals, our Union will again be proudly in the lead. In the lead for the protection of our planet, of the future of new generations and of the most vulnerable people to climate change. So thank you and I look forward for this debate.","Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, this House is addressing the defining challenge of this century, of our generations and also of this Commission’s mandate.

José Manuel Fernandes ,PPE," This joint motion for a resolution, replacing the motions by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is intended to promote the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (TBVI) with a view to meeting the targets defined by the United Nations in the Millennium Development Goals. These include reversing the trend in the number of patients with tuberculosis by 2015 and eliminating the disease by 2050. Improving the state of health of the world population is one of the European Union’s major concerns. Although tuberculosis can be said to be controlled in Europe, it still causes the deaths of millions of people in developing countries, in association with other contagious diseases. It is essential to pool political and financial efforts in order to put a swift end to this worldwide scourge. I therefore welcome the approval of this initiative to eradicate this contagious disease, which even in the 21st century is still causing many deaths, especially in developing countries.","This joint motion for a resolution, replacing the motions by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is intended to promote the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative with a view to meeting the targets defined by the United Nations in the Millennium Development Goals.

Despite the fact that levelling everything down has led to disaster, centralism is still being heralded as a cure-all. Italy and France have long been working on forcing the net contributors, particularly Germany, into a debt and liability union. The role of Germany as EU paymaster-general is to be incorporated into the Treaties so that the German economic giant can be permanently subdued. It is a kick in the teeth to the economically successful euro area countries that candidates for bankruptcy will de facto receive funds from the EFSF or from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) without having to make any cuts. If the troika is to exercise no control over adherence to the budgets set, it represents a licence for all kinds of fraud and cheating.

Elżbieta Bieńkowska,N/A,"Madam President, thank you very much for this question as it allows me to update you on the state of play of the implementation of the two regulations on medical devices. I know this is an extremely important issue. We all want the continuous availability of safe and innovative medical devices and, of course, for this we need a smooth transition to the new system. Let me underline, at the very beginning, that so far all relevant legal deadlines established by the regulations have been met. Work is advancing and progressing according to the plans. This was the case for the establishment of the governance structure; the launch of the designation code and procedure for notified bodies; and the delivery of the new plan for the implementation of the new medical devices database (EUDAMED). We had already prepared for the future even before the regulations were adopted. We established effective cooperation with the national competent authorities for medical devices. Together with them, we have elaborated a roadmap of activities to be undertaken during the transitional period. Work is on track to implement the roadmap, again together with the expert groups. We are in continuous dialogue with the notified bodies, industry and all other relevant stakeholders.  As was said in the speech by Ms McGuinness, there are three directorates—general cooperating and sharing responsibilities. We are putting a lot of human resources on this file. But let me assure you, we have a very common understanding of the topic and of the issues between our Commission services. Also, Member States have mobilised their resources to contribute to the implementation process and Member States are fully committed, in the form of the competent authorities for medical devices, to preparing for the future. We are aware that we need enough notified bodies by the end of the transition period. This is a key precondition for the smooth transition. The Commission has set up the entire legal and technical infrastructure to allow for the designation procedure to start as soon as possible. Again, I want to underline that we have been ready from the very first legal date, which was 27 December last year. The number of applications received so far shows that the designation procedure is overall on track.  So far, there have been no delays in assessing the applications of notified bodies. But of course we should not only look at the numbers. The top priority is patient safety. So we should remember that the lack of effective control of the notified bodies under the old system was one of the main reasons to review the medical devices framework. A large share of the responsibility now lies with the notified bodies themselves, as well as with the operators. It is also up to them to prepare and prove their fitness under the revised framework.  A few words on Brexit as it is an extremely important issue. As for all other sectors, this is also a challenge for the medical devices industry. So far, four notified bodies have been established in the UK. In its public notice of January this year, the Commission advised stakeholders to take all necessary measures because, as we all know, a certificate issued by UK notified bodies will no longer be valid as from 29 March next year.  Many other sectors, of course, face the same situation, but, as far as we know, the UK notified bodies and industry associations have been extremely active in preparing for Brexit ahead of time. Four notified bodies have already taken the initiative to adapt to the post—Brexit scenario. Again, we should not rest on our laurels, but for now, we see that they were very proactive and active. So let me conclude by saying that we are on track. There are no deviations from the requirements and deadlines established by Parliament and the Council. So for now, there is no reason to ring the alarm bell. But of course there is still a lot of work ahead of us: first to ensure the transition to the new system but also the availability of devices over the next few years. Therefore, we in the Commission, together we will monitor the implementation process in very close and very constant cooperation with the national competent authorities, the Member States of course, and all other stakeholders.","Madam President, thank you very much for this question as it allows me to update you on the state of play of the implementation of the two regulations on medical devices.

This was the case for the establishment of the governance structure; the launch of the designation code and procedure for notified bodies; and the delivery of the new plan for the implementation of the new medical devices database . We had already prepared for the future even before the regulations were adopted. We established effective cooperation with the national competent authorities for medical devices. Together with them, we have elaborated a roadmap of activities to be undertaken during the transitional period. Work is on track to implement the roadmap, again together with the expert groups. We are in continuous dialogue with the notified bodies, industry and all other relevant stakeholders. As was said in the speech by Ms McGuinness, there are three directorates—general cooperating and sharing responsibilities. We are putting a lot of human resources on this file. But let me assure you, we have a very common understanding of the topic and of the issues between our Commission services. Also, Member States have mobilised their resources to contribute to the implementation process and Member States are fully committed, in the form of the competent authorities for medical devices, to preparing for the future. We are aware that we need enough notified bodies by the end of the transition period. This is a key precondition for the smooth transition. The Commission has set up the entire legal and technical infrastructure to allow for the designation procedure to start as soon as possible. Again, I want to underline that we have been ready from the very first legal date, which was 27 December last year. The number of applications received so far shows that the designation procedure is overall on track. So far, there have been no delays in assessing the applications of notified bodies. But of course we should not only look at the numbers. The top priority is patient safety. So we should remember that the lack of effective control of the notified bodies under the old system was one of the main reasons to review the medical devices framework. A large share of the responsibility now lies with the notified bodies themselves, as well as with the operators. It is also up to them to prepare and prove their fitness under the revised framework. A few words on Brexit as it is an extremely important issue. As for all other sectors, this is also a challenge for the medical devices industry. So far, four notified bodies have been established in the UK. In its public notice of January this year, the Commission advised stakeholders to take all necessary measures because, as we all know, a certificate issued by UK notified bodies will no longer be valid as from 29 March next year. Many other sectors, of course, face the same situation, but, as far as we know, the UK notified bodies and industry associations have been extremely active in preparing for Brexit ahead of time. Four notified bodies have already taken the initiative to adapt to the post—Brexit scenario. Again, we should not rest on our laurels, but for now, we see that they were very proactive and active. So let me conclude by saying that we are on track. There are no deviations from the requirements and deadlines established by Parliament and the Council. So for now, there is no reason to ring the alarm bell. But of course there is still a lot of work ahead of us: first to ensure the transition to the new system but also the availability of devices over the next few years. Therefore, we in the Commission, together we will monitor the implementation process in very close and very constant cooperation with the national competent authorities, the Member States of course, and all other stakeholders.","Madam President, thank you very much for this question as it allows me to update you on the state of play of the implementation of the two regulations on medical devices. I know this is an extremely important issue. We all want the continuous availability of safe and innovative medical devices and, of course, for this we need a smooth transition to the new system. Let me underline, at the very beginning, that so far all relevant legal deadlines established by the regulations have been met. Work ",nan

We complain about the survival of the apparatus of the Soviet Union there and yet we maintain our common agricultural policy, our social chapter, our 48-hour week and the rest of the apparatus of euro-corporatism. It is a small wonder that the old systemic communist parties of the COMECON states were leading the ‘yes’ campaigns when their countries applied to join the Evropeyskiy soyuz.

Irene Tinagli,S&D," – Mr President, a good economic governance must have two characteristics – ambition and credibility – and credibility does not rhyme necessarily with the severity as many claim. Credibility is measured by the economic, social and political sustainability of those rules. And if rules are not sustainable over time, governance is not credible. So the old governance was perhaps ambitious, but not particularly credible – it hasn’t proved that over time. The review launched by the Commission shall set the right balance between ambition and credibility. The proposals are already moving in the right direction, but frankly, I believe that something more needs to be done to guarantee an adequate level of public investment, because these investments are key to growth in private investments as well, and these will ensure the digital, environmental and social transition challenges that we have ahead of us and this is what really we need to do to meet our citizens’ expectations.  So, more investments today means more growth, more jobs for tomorrow and in the end, that’s what we are called to deliver. This is what citizens expect from us. This is how we can be credible.","– Mr President, a good economic governance must have two characteristics – ambition and credibility – and credibility does not rhyme necessarily with the severity as many claim.

John Bufton,ID,"Mr President, when the EU ordered the postal sector to open up to competition, it destroyed a vital British service.

Now there are fewer than 12 000 despite a population boom. After being forced to sell off their profit-making arm, post offices could not stay open without government support. Thousands shut, stripping communities of access to vital services. The EU postal reform says that good quality postal services should be available throughout the Union.

Guy Verhofstadt,ALDE," – Mr President, dear colleagues, I have listened, Mr Bek, to the long list of items that you will discuss tomorrow and after tomorrow in the Council, but I have to tell you the most important items were not there. That is, in my opinion, the sanctions and the weapons that Ukraine needs to end this war the fastest as possible.  You can all talk about price caps on oil and gas, but the best way to end the energy crisis is to end the war. For that, Ukraine needs to win the war. There, for the moment, what we see is that weak sanctions create weak results. It’s ten months and what we see is an escalation of brutality of Russia in Ukraine – rape, genocide, deportations of children in that country.  So what I want and expect of the European Council is that, first of all, you start a decision to give more weapons. These discussions about Patriots, about Leopards, of the European governments is a scandal! You need to send them, to transfer them to Ukraine so that they can win the war.  The second item is on sanctions – there are still, dear colleagues, 11 oligarchs of the most important oligarchs not on the list of sanctions in Europe. In total, after the ninth package – remember you are already on the ninth package – there will be 1 400, 1 500 or maybe 1 600 on the sanction list and, in total, there are 6 000, 7 000 people that need to be on the sanction list, because they are the real backbone.  The same for Iran. Will you discuss, in fact now, sanctions for Iran? Can we still support Iranian diplomats on the territory of Europe, dear colleagues? We need to expel them the fastest as possible from Europe. That is what we need to do, and that is what I expect: sanctions and weapons for Ukraine and sanctions against Iran at the next European Council.","– Mr President, dear colleagues, I have listened, Mr Bek, to the long list of items that you will discuss tomorrow and after tomorrow in the Council, but I have to tell you the most important items were not there.

Tomasz Piotr Poręba ,ECR," Mr President, tomorrow in Brussels, we shall see to what extent the new European budget will strengthen European solidarity and cohesion and to what extent it will serve the particular interests of the net contributors. To what extent there will be investment in our shared development, in rapid growth for the European Union, and to what extent it will be a budget of stagnation, a budget that reinforces the differences between individual European Union Member States.  It is understandable, ladies and gentlemen, that we should be talking today about potential cuts to the budget, about the budget amount. That is natural and entirely justified. However, far less attention is being paid, here and in the public sphere, to how the proposals on the negotiating table could prevent, weaken and restrict the future absorption of EU funding by European Union Member States. I am talking, here, about the end to VAT eligibility, about macro-economic conditionality, which will determine the absorption of EU funding. I am talking about capping, about the system of net corrections for projects, which means that, contrary to what is stated in the current financial perspective, future projects not subject to European Union supervision will be rejected by Brussels and have their funding returned to the EU.  Ladies and gentlemen, we must ask ourselves today whether the restrictive arrangements and rules included in the negotiating proposals that will be discussed tomorrow in Brussels do not simply serve to restrict the future absorption of EU funding under the new financial perspective. If that is the case, both new and old Member States should seriously consider substantially toning down these proposals and, failing that, countries such as Poland should simply exercise their right of veto.","Mr President, tomorrow in Brussels, we shall see to what extent the new European budget will strengthen European solidarity and cohesion and to what extent it will serve the particular interests of the net contributors.

Marisa Matias,GUE/NGL," – Senhor Presidente, alguns membros deste Parlamento tiveram a oportunidade de conhecer Daphne Caruana Galizia antes de ela ter sido assassinada, quando trabalhávamos numa comissão de inquérito parlamentar onde foram revelados formulários de abertura de contas em paraísos fiscais por parte do Chefe de Gabinete do Primeiro-Ministro, por parte do ministro agora demissionário. Daphne Caruana Galizia colaborou com este Parlamento e cooperou com uma das comissões parlamentares e quando ela foi assassinada foi uma parte do Estado de direito em Malta que foi assassinado também. Na verdade, o que temos em Malta é uma porta aberta para a corrupção, seja por via dos paraísos fiscais, seja por via dos vistos Gold. E, como acabei de referir, o facto de não termos a proteção necessária para o jornalismo de investigação é uma garantia de que a democracia não funciona. Temos um batalhão de jornalistas que procuram proteger a democracia. Precisamos ter um batalhão de governantes que defendam o jornalismo de investigação e que defendam os jornalistas. A presença destes membros no Governo até há cerca de duas semanas, a presença ainda de Muscat no governo, não nos dá nenhuma garantia de que haja uma investigação imparcial em relação ao assassinato de Daphne Caruana Galizia. E, nesse sentido, devemos apelar. Não no sentido da interferência, mas no sentido do respeito e da proteção do Estado de direito. Que o Sr. Muscat se retire. E, caros Colegas e caras Colegas, devemos dar-nos ao respeito. Não é uma corrida para o fundo. Não é saber quem tem o pior caso, se é Malta, se é a Hungria, se é a Polónia, se é a Eslováquia.

Siôn Simon ,S&D,"Mr President, we do not just need more jobs, we need better jobs. Of course there is a jobs crisis in the EU, but there is also a skills crisis and a quality crisis. What there is not is a flexibility crisis or a price crisis. The sector of the economy with the worst unemployment is precisely the sector with the highest so-called flexibility and the worst conditions – the sector of zero hours contracts, of bogus self-employment and of perpetual part-time temporary agency contracts. So if these mechanisms are – as we are asked to believe – a necessary tool for employers to get people into the labour market and keep people in the labour market, then they do not work. In which case, can I ask the Commission why none of these issues are in the country-specific recommendations?","Mr President, we do not just need more jobs, we need better jobs.

Agnes Jongerius,N/A,"deputising for the rapporteur. – Madam President, for me it’s a great honour to be here and indeed I’m not Vilija Blinkevičiūtė, who is the rapporteur of this file, but she is ill at the moment, so she asked me to deliver her speech. So I’m going to do this as best I can. So please bear with me and pretend that I’m Vilija. I think here today we are here to discuss the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (EGF) and, for health reasons, I’m not able to be here with you today, but my colleague Ms Jongerius will present my position as Parliament’s rapporteur. To start, I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to everyone who was involved in the EGF negotiations. It was thanks to your efforts and your dedication that we were able to achieve an excellent result. So a big thanks goes to all my colleagues, all the shadow rapporteurs, of course, also Maria Arena, who was a rapporteur during the previous mandate, Commissioner Schmit, and the colleague from the Commission, the Croatian, the German Presidency and the current Council team and, of course, to all the staff. I’m convinced that the outcome of the negotiations and the agreement that we found with the Council will further strengthen the EGF and its very important instruments to help dismissed workers. This will be crucial in the difficult times to come, with the immense social and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people have lost their jobs already and it’s our job to help them to find new employment. The new EGF is far better equipped to respond to these challenges. Let me briefly remind you of the most significant achievements. Firstly, the EGF interventions will no longer be exclusively linked to globalisation or an economic or financial crisis, but will cover any restructuring events in the future of a company, a sector or a region. This change will make the EGF far more accessible than before.  We have managed to introduce a threshold of dismissed workers from currently 500 to 200, which allows more dismissed workers to benefit from the EGF matches, therefore increasing their chances to return to employment again. We expect that both the increased scope and the lower threshold will result in an increase of applications, and the EGF has an annual ceiling of EUR 186 million to provide for support.  Much to my regret, the Member States were not willing to agree on a higher ceiling as demanded by Parliament and the Commission, not even in the light of the current crisis. We were, however, successful in securing a childcare allowance, among other special time-limited measures to support dismissed workers. I think it’s of extreme importance, as it will have also a practical importance in daily life for people with children who are already struggling at the moment. They can rest assured that they have the means to provide for their family while participating in reskilling or any other vocational training or education activities supported by the EGF.  We also increased the amount of financial support to EUR 20 000 for dismissed workers who wish to start their own businesses, and we hope it will provide a good incentive for entrepreneurship. Last but not least, the new name of the EGF is from now on the European Globalisation Fund for Displaced Workers. It has been changed to underline the true mission of this fund, namely to support the workers who lost their jobs and to avoid any misunderstandings of the past that the fund supports companies that lay off workers. To wrap up, I really am convinced and proud that for the next seven years we have reinforced the EGF, which is much better equipped to support people who have lost their jobs and to return them to sustainable employment.  Just as a last sentence on behalf of myself, on behalf of our whole political group, the S&D Group, I  really want to thank Vilija for all her hard work on this important file. She did a great job and she managed to get support for even more workers throughout Europe and to help them to return to sustainable employment in these times of need, and I think this is very much appreciated, so thank you for that, Vilija.","deputising for the rapporteur. – Madam President, for me it’s a great honour to be here and indeed I’m not Vilija Blinkevičiūtė, who is the rapporteur of this file, but she is ill at the moment, so she asked me to deliver her speech.

João Ferreira ,GUE/NGL," The amendments made to the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure by this report are aimed at legalising an interinstitutional negotiating procedure that has been conducted abusively and that smacks of the interests of the largest political groups: the right and the social democrats. The coordination between these forces undermines the transparency of discussion processes. This is not an amendment in the democratic sense of how Parliament operates – which is more than needed. It is instead a procedural change, which, among other things, enables, where the committee responsible considers it duly justified, negotiations to be entered into prior to the adoption of the report in the specialised committee. In other words, trilogue negotiations begin without groups like our own having had the opportunity to table any proposals. The major groups agree so full steam ahead! This is an amendment that limits the ability of groups like ours to intervene, make proposals and raise complaints, groups like ours that break with this consensus that also dominates the other EU institutions and which is, after all, responsible for the process of civilisation going backwards that is now being experienced in Europe.","The amendments made to the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure by this report are aimed at legalising an interinstitutional negotiating procedure that has been conducted abusively and that smacks of the interests of the largest political groups: the right and the social democrats.

Robert Rochefort ,ALDE," Every 24 seconds, another person is diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease in the EU. Almost one in 20 people over the age of 65 and one in five over 80 suffer from dementia. Alzheimer’s disease is responsible for more than half of these cases. In total, more than 8 million Europeans aged between 30 and 99 are affected, and scientists estimate that this number could double every 20 years in future. The European Union has to take initiatives so that the increase in the number of people affected by these diseases can be addressed in the coming decades. I endorsed the European Parliament resolution calling, in particular, on the Member States to take steps to help slow down the disease’s progression in sufferers – such as promoting healthy lifestyles and ensuring that medication is available to all sufferers – to establish specialist centres, to provide satisfactory medical equipment nationwide, and to draw up strategic action plans for research in this area.","Every 24 seconds, another person is diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease in the EU.

Dimitrios Kourkoulas,N/A,"Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for this interesting debate. We have heard a wide range of interventions on the various issues – all inter-related – which are on the agenda for next week’s European Council. All these issues go hand in hand; even our concerns about developments in Ukraine can only be addressed if we deal with them in a serious and coordinated manner, and that cannot be separated entirely from our record on economic and social policies. Some of you have underlined the social aspects. I agree with you that this is a vital part of the European Union which is based on the notion of the social market economy. If there appears to be an imbalance between market and social elements, then that is mainly because social policy still lies largely in the hands of the Member States. We coordinate and we share experiences, but the responsibility lies primarily at national level. Economic recovery in Europe is there, but it reminds fragile, so we have to continue to take the Semester process very seriously. It is only one of many tools but it is an important part of our Europe-wide strategy for ensuring sustained economic growth and job creation. As was mentioned by many Members of this Parliament, progress has been achieved: in the area of economic governance, important financial regulations have been mentioned, such as the Growth and Stability Pact and the very important measures taken by the European Central Bank. Banking union is, of course, of vital importance. It is our ambition, as the Greek Presidency, to have the Single Resolution Mechanism adopted during the mandate of this European Parliament. A crucial trilogue will take place here today in Strasbourg at 15.00 with the Greek Finance Minister and the President of the Eurogroup. Our Presidency has received a new mandate. Let us hope that this will be a solid basis for a compromise, otherwise I think we will have to go back to our governments and ask for a more flexible mandate. I would say, and I conclude, that this is a matter of the credibility of the European Union as a whole.","Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for this interesting debate.

Such monitoring, however, cannot take the ideological form of a set of parameters applying to everyone. In fact, the situation in every market niche should be examined on a case by case basis in order to carry out a fair evaluation of them in terms of respecting those principles which, if applied mechanically, would end up generating paradoxical and anti-economic situations.

Ryszard Czarnecki,ECR," Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Hoyer, congratulations on taking on your new and important, perhaps increasingly important, function. I would like firstly to emphasise that, in my view, as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control and, even more importantly, as a politician from a poor country, namely Poland, it is extremely important for the European Investment Bank to continue and to give much more priority to its assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises, which, in reality, represent the part of the economy in each country that enables us to weather the present crisis more successfully. Large firms have large problems, while small companies can be more flexible, but they deserve our support and assistance. You have supported 100 000 small companies, but that is too few, and EUR 10 billion is too little. I am calling for more to be done. I would also like to say that the European Investment Bank should be an investing bank, that is, a bank that expects a return on its investments. Investment projects cannot be ideological in nature. To be entirely honest, I have the impression that some of the projects that relate to combating global warming or reducing CO2 emissions appear to be driven more by ideology than by economic or financial considerations.","Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Hoyer, congratulations on taking on your new and important, perhaps increasingly important, function.

Dominik Tarczyński,ECR," – Madam President, Madam President, I wish the most influential people in the world could listen to this debate. What a fascinating debate, Madam President. Madam President, I would love to hear this debate in the presence of the most influential people. Do you know who are the most influential people in the world according to Forbes? Michelle Obama, Ursula von der Leyen, Christine Lagarde, Kamala Harris and hundreds of women around the world. Hundreds of women around the world.  We had our influential women decades ago, Marie Salomea Skłodowska Curie. We had the first country in Europe, which allowed women to vote, what country was it? Poland.  Now, if you want to learn what equality is, come to Poland, because Poland by the data, – its Eurostat’s, it’s not our data – is number two. We are the second country with the highest number of women in management. The first is Latvia and the second is Poland. Where is the EU? Let me see, oh, 34%, more or less. There you are, very, very low.  So if you want to learn, come to Poland because that’s what it is. It’s not about creating ridiculous ideas, fighting against Christmas. It’s about logic.

Manfred Weber,PPE,"Herr Präsident, Herr Ratspräsident, Herr Kommissionspräsident, lieber Kommissar Avramopoulos – der hervorragende Arbeit macht –, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Wir waren mit der EVP-Fraktion letzte Woche in Italien, haben dort eine Tagung durchgeführt, und ein italienischer Kollege hat bei dieser Diskussion einen Erfahrungsbericht von einem der Flüchtlingscamps geschildert. Er hat darauf verwiesen, dass er dort eine Familie getroffen hat, die in Eritrea mit fünf Kindern gestartet ist und in Italien mit einem Kind angekommen ist. Er hat beschrieben, in welche leeren Augen er geblickt hat, als er dieses Gespräch geführt hat. Im letzten Jahr 3 500 – nach Schätzungen – und in diesem Jahr bereits 1 600, die im Mittelmeer umgekommen sind. Die Tragödie bewegt uns alle, und sie motiviert uns jetzt, voranzugehen. Ich bedanke mich beim Ratspräsidenten, dass er die Initiative ergriffen hat, die Chefs zusammenzuholen. Die Ergebnisse insbesondere bei der Finanzierung der Seenotrettung und auch die Ergebnisse bei der Bekämpfung der Schlepperorganisationen sind gut, sind Schritte in die richtige Richtung. Ich glaube, dass wir – so wie der Kommissionspräsident es ausgeführt hat – jetzt ambitioniert daran weiterarbeiten müssen. Ein Punkt, der uns in der EVP beim Weiterarbeiten bewegt, ist die Frage der Lastenverteilung in Europa. Wir haben die Situation, dass derzeit nur wenige Staaten die Lasten tragen. Das wird ein Thema sein, das die Kommission vorschlägt. Und bei einer fairen, gerechten Lastenverteilung hat die Kommission auch unsere Unterstützung. Wir haben als Zweites bei der Weiterentwicklung zu sehen, dass wir bei der Stabilisierung Afrikas – insbesondere Afrikas – noch mehr tun müssen. Ich möchte ausdrücklich darauf verweisen, dass wir als Europäer nicht nur selbstkritisch damit umgehen, sondern auch mal bei einigen Punkten stolz sein sollten. Die EU-Kommission beispielsweise hat in den letzten Jahren in Somalia viel europäisches Geld ausgegeben, dort eine afrikanische Stabilisierungsinitiative gestartet, was dazu geführt hat, dass Somalia heute stabil ist und deutlich weniger Flüchtlinge aus Somalia kommen. Wir haben auch Erfolge, und über die muss man auch reden. Ich würde mir aber in der Diskussion um Afrika auch eines wünschen: Wenn wir jetzt Richtung Mittelmeer blicken und uns immer wieder gegenseitig sagen, was Europa noch alles machen muss, wo Europa versagt, dann dürfen wir als europäische Politiker selbstkritisch sein – keine Frage –, aber wir dürfen schon auch sehr deutlich sagen: Die Hauptversager sitzen nicht in Europa, sie sitzen in Afrika. Dort haben wir Staaten und Politiker, die korrupt sind und ihren Menschen keine Perspektive geben. Und darüber muss man auch ehrlich reden. Wir haben zwei Punkte, worüber wir strittige Diskussionen haben. Alle sind sich einig, dass wir syrische Flüchtlinge aufnehmen müssen, dass wir Bürgerkriegsflüchtlinge aufnehmen müssen. Leider Gottes ist aber die Lage, dass zwei Drittel aller Bewerber, die letztes Jahr europäischen Boden betreten haben, nach einem rechtsstaatlichen Verfahren abgelehnt worden sind und keinen Flüchtlingsstatus nachweisen konnten. Herr Kommissionspräsident, deswegen brauchen wir auch eine Diskussion über sichere Drittstaaten. Wen können wir schnell wieder rückführen, wenn kein Flüchtlingsgrund vorliegt? Die EU-Kommission muss bei der Ausgabe von Entwicklungshilfegeldern auch mit den afrikanischen Staaten verhandeln und sagen: Wir geben euch gerne Geld für eure Entwicklung, aber dann nehmt bitte eure Staatsbürger, die keinen Fluchtgrund haben, auch wieder zurück. Wenn es uns nicht gelingt, die Abgelehnten wieder zurückzuführen, dann werden wir auf Dauer die Unterstützung der Bürger für das Asylrecht verlieren. Das ist eine große Sorge, die uns umtreibt. Deswegen müssen wir klar sein: Zwei Drittel der Bewerber müssen auch wieder rückgeführt werden. Ich möchte noch einen weiteren kritischen Punkt anschneiden, nämlich die Frage der legalen Migration. Wir sind uns einig: Wenn wir bei der Blauen Karte, wenn wir bei einzelnen Initiativen, die wir in Europa haben, besser werden, wird es von uns allen getragen. Da können wir besser werden. Da können wir europäische Ansätze machen. Aber wer behauptet, dass wir, wenn wir die Türen für legale Zuwanderung auf Arbeitsmärkte öffnen, dann das Elend im Mittelmeer beenden werden, der macht sich und den Menschen etwas vor. Über welche Quoten reden wir denn? Reden wir denn über 100 000, über 500 000, über 1 Million Afrikaner, die wir dann hereinlassen? Wenn wir über Quoten reden, dann werden immer noch Millionen Afrikaner gerne eine Hoffnung in Europa suchen und den Weg übers Mittelmeer versuchen. Über legale Zuwanderung wird man das Problem nicht lösen. Und wer hier den Kopf schüttelt, den darf man auch einmal auf die innereuropäische Debatte darüber verweisen, dass jeder fünfte Jugendliche auf diesem Kontinent keine Arbeit hat. Dann möchte ich ehrlich die Diskussion führen, ob es angesichts dieser sozialen Faktenlage auf unserem Kontinent ernsthaft richtig ist, jetzt Türen zu öffnen. Diese Diskussion muss man ehrlicherweise führen. Wir glauben, dass es Möglichkeiten gibt, hier besser zu werden – keine Frage –, aber wir glauben nicht, dass es eine Lösung für die illegale Migration ist, wenn wir jetzt in Masse legale Wege nach Europa öffnen. Europa steht vor einer großen Aufgabe. Ich glaube, dass in den Diskussionen, die wir in den nächsten Wochen darüber führen werden, auch deutlich wird, dass es nicht einen einzigen Ansatz, sondern auch parteipolitische Debatten dazu gibt, auch Richtungsdebatten dazu gibt, darüber, wie man damit umgeht. Wo wir uns einig sind, ist, dass die Humanität Europas bei dieser Frage auf dem Prüfstand steht. Und diese Humanität müssen wir mit einem klaren Ja beantworten. Das Sterben im Mittelmeer muss beendet werden.

Резолюцията, която предлагаме, дава шанс да започнем преговори и да има друг резултат в Европейския парламент. Малко по-рано днес Председателят Барозу каза, че Европейският съюз има нужда от многогодишна финансова рамка. Бих допълнил, не от каквато и да е многогодишна финансова рамка.

Един от тях е: Може ли Европейският съюз да помогне за излизането от кризата? Ние тук чухме какви ли не мнения (някои от тях много странни). Отговорът е определено: Да, ако Европейският съюз стимулира инвестициите в икономиките, ако спестява национални средства (както се случва примерно с помощта за развитие), ако създава добавена стойност (както се случва с европейските инфраструктури, с програмата ""Еразъм"", с младите хора). При всички тези случаи европейският бюджет създава работни места и растеж. И то ги създава по-добре, отколкото ако тези средства се похарчат на национално равнище, а тях ги няма на национално равнище (държавите не разполагат с тях). Това, което се договориха правителствените ръководители, е един бюджет, който е на равнища като отношение от брутния вътрешен продукт от 1989 година. Ние се опитваме да решаваме проблемите на 2020 година с бюджет от 1989 година ─ 0,94 % плащания от БВП. Това е абсолютно невъзможно.  Затова искаме преговори.

This European Parliament report confirms the EU institutions’ compromise decision, on the basis of which the European Union will be able to provide the most deprived citizens of the European Union with the same amount of food aid as before for the remaining two years until the new multiannual financial framework. Indeed, the Council’s desire to reduce the amount of food aid at this difficult time, when the number of people requiring aid has grown as a result of the crisis, was particularly difficult to understand. I agree that today, we have to make savings, both at EU level and in the Member States, but we cannot do this by reducing assistance for the poorest people who have increased in number. Savings in this area would not solve the problem of the financial crisis. Instead, we would be turning our backs on our citizens and undermining the goals that we set ourselves a year ago – of lifting as many as 20 million people out of the poverty trap. It really is disappointing that this has dragged on for so long.","I voted in favour of this report because I fully support what it has achieved.

Monika Flašíková Beňová ,S&D," The gradual reforms of the common market organisation for milk and milk products were market-oriented in order to promote the competitiveness of milk and the milk products sector and its sustainability in the context of globalised trade. In 2007-2009, exceptional developments took place in the milk and milk products sector. Initially, extreme weather conditions in Oceania brought about a significant decline in supplies, leading to a rapid and significant increase in prices. Yet, while world supplies had started their recovery, and prices had started to return to more normal levels, the subsequent financial and economic crisis negatively affected EU dairy producers, aggravating price volatility. In light of the difficult market situation for the milk sector, and while respecting the outcome of a review of reforms to the common agricultural policy, an expert group was to work on a regulatory framework to be put in place, in order to contribute to stabilising the market and producers’ income and enhancing its transparency. In order to ensure the rational development of production and a fair standard of living for dairy farmers, their bargaining power vis-à-vis processors should be strengthened, which should result in a fairer distribution of value-added along the supply chain.","The gradual reforms of the common market organisation for milk and milk products were market-oriented in order to promote the competitiveness of milk and the milk products sector and its sustainability in the context of globalised trade.

James Elles ,ECR,"I welcome the report tabled on the financial regulation today, which should be strongly supported for the following three reasons.

Tomasz Frankowski,N/A,"sprawozdawca. – Szanowna Pani Przewodnicząca! Sport nie tylko zmienia świat, ale wielu ludziom pozwala zmienić życie. Sport ma ogromną moc jednoczenia ludzi bez względu na rasę, religię, płeć, kulturę czy status społeczno-ekonomiczny. Pomaga nam zachować zdrowie i szczęście oraz uczy nas cennych umiejętności w każdym wieku. Sport jest coraz ważniejszą dziedziną gospodarki, która generuje prawie 3 proc. PKB Unii i zapewnia miejsce pracy dla prawie sześciu milionów osób.  Jednak sport w Europie znajduje się również na ważnym rozdrożu. Minęło ponad 10 lat od czasu, gdy Traktat Lizboński dał Unii Europejskiej mandat do działania w dziedzinie sportu. Pandemia była niezwykle trudna dla sektora sportu, zwłaszcza na poziomie amatorskim. Dlatego sport i jego wartości potrzebują większej widoczności i działań w Unii.  Uważam, że kluczowa jest współpraca wszystkich organizacji zaangażowanych w sport i instytucji państwowych. Powinny one wypracować wspólne założenia i spójny plan działań na przyszłość. Sport powinien być ponownie w portfolio odpowiedzialnego komisarza Unii Europejskiej, a Komisja Europejska powinna wyznaczyć osobnego koordynatora do spraw sportu.  Chciałbym, by w przyszłości ponownie została utworzona intergrupa sportowa w Parlamencie. Ważne jest, aby sport mógł korzystać z innych polityk unijnych w zakresie zdrowia, zatrudnienia, młodzieży, edukacji, rynku wewnętrznego czy środowiska. W tym celu polityka sportowa wymaga dalszego włączania w główny nurt polityki i koordynacji. Jest to recepta na sukces na kolejną dekadę.  Jednym z naszych podstawowych zadań jest rozwijanie w Europie modelu sportu opartego na wartościach, zasadzie solidarności, sprawiedliwości i integracji w ramach otwartych zawodów. Głównym wyzwaniem stojącym przed nami jest promowanie europejskiego modelu sportu i chronienie go przed zagrożeniami takimi jak ostatnio głośna Superliga.  Dziś wysyłamy bardzo jasny komunikat: sport jest dla wszystkich. Musimy osiągnąć właściwą równowagę między realizacją komercyjnych interesów a funkcjami społecznymi sportu. Musimy zadbać o to, by był bezpieczny, dostępny, integracyjny i równy dla wszystkich. Powinien służyć i przynosić korzyści wszystkim, ale nie tylko zawodowcom. Dlatego w sprawozdaniu proponujemy zwiększenie finansowania sportu na poziomie lokalnym oraz zwiększoną redystrybucję środków między sportem zawodowym i amatorskim. Ma to zasadnicze znaczenie dla wspierania mniej dochodowych zawodów, takich jak turnieje kobiece, młodzieżowe, które są ważne dla długoterminowego rozwoju sportu. Sport powinien korzystać ze zwiększonej części finansowania nie tylko w ramach polityki spójności, ale także nowego instrumentu na rzecz odbudowy i odporności.  Zapewnienie dodatkowych środków finansowych dla sportu jest sprawą najwyższej wagi. W przyszłych programach, takich jak Erasmus Plus, sport powinien otrzymać jeszcze więcej środków, powinien wspierać przejście na zrównoważoną i innowacyjną przyszłość. W związku z tym organizacje sportowe są odpowiedzialne za rozwijanie zielonego programu działań w sporcie poprzez dostosowanie swojej polityki do celów unijnych działań na rzecz klimatu i środowiska.  Istnieje również potrzeba nowego, bardziej kolektywnego podejścia do zarządzania sportem. Wszyscy przedstawiciele powinni być zaangażowani w to zarządzanie, włączając ligi, kluby, sportowców, kibiców czy wolontariuszy. Należy wprowadzić konkretne środki na rzecz różnorodności pod względem organizacyjnym i włączenia społecznego. Potrzeba nam również więcej kobiet na stanowiskach menedżerskich.

Co więcej, sport nie może służyć dyktatorom, dlatego wzywamy do zaprzestania organizowania dużych imprez w krajach, w których stale naruszane są podstawowe prawa i wartości. Organizacje sportowe muszą przestrzegać ustalonej częstotliwości ważnych międzynarodowych imprez sportowych, stawiając zdrowie sportowców na pierwszym miejscu.

Fulvio Martusciello,PPE,"a nome del gruppo PPE. – Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, signor Commissario, noi abbiamo lavorato con grande energia a questo dossier. Ancora una volta, anche quest'anno, abbiamo individuato una serie di punti che sono distorsivi, a nostro parere, della concorrenza.  Ogni anno facciamo sempre lo stesso lavoro. Mi chiedo quanti punti che abbiamo individuato nelle relazioni degli scorsi anni sono stati poi attuati, sono stati poi valutati dalla Commissione. Non sarebbe il caso che la Commissione, prima di farci avventurare in questo lavoro, ci desse conto di come ha utilizzato il lavoro dell'anno precedente?  Io ho fatto uno studio e ho visto che, ad esempio su quello del 2017,la Commissione ne ha analizzati pochi, 2 o 3 su 181 che ne avevamo individuati. E ritengo che il primo punto distorsivo della concorrenza, Commissario, sia la differenza di tassazione fra gli Stati membri, l'utilizzo che fanno alcuni Stati membri delle politiche fiscali per potersene avvantaggiare.  Io sono partito da Napoli, dalla mia città nel sud Italia, e mi sono fermato a fare il diesel e l'ho pagato 1,7 EUR. Poi mi sono fermato in Lussemburgo e il diesel l'ho pagato 1,1 EUR, perché il Lussemburgo usa la leva fiscale per attrarre investimenti, per attrarre consumatori, e naturalmente le stesse cose accadono in altri paesi dell'Unione.  Questa è la vera anomalia, il vero elemento distorsivo della concorrenza, insieme all'accettazione placida che avviene del boicottaggio. Abbiamo cercato di inserire, a più riprese, in questa relazione la condanna assoluta del boicottaggio dei prodotti provenienti da un'area geografica soltanto perché provenienti da quell'area geografica. Ebbene non ci siamo riusciti per l'ostruzionismo messo in campo dalle forze di sinistra presenti tra i relatori d'ombra.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me start by thanking this Parliament for its valuable work and for its continuous support to address what has become one of the main threats to our planet – global deforestation.  Let me congratulate you, Ms Burkhardt, and the entire Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on your important report, which calls for an EU legal framework to halt and reverse EU—driven global deforestation. It is good to see that we agree on the importance of this subject, and that we share a sense of urgency.  Our EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 stresses the importance of increasing the quantity, quality and resilience of our own forests. But while the area covered by forests in Europe increases, forest degradation and international deforestation threaten the well—being of all of us. Deforestation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, causing climate change. It is pushing animals and plants to extinction and affecting the rights of indigenous peoples in some parts of the world. In short, it is akin to choking life on Earth.  Deforestation is also a complex problem, and there is no easy solution. No major economy in the world has yet managed to eliminate products linked to deforestation for its supply chains, and yet this is exactly what we have to do and what we plan to do. EU demand and consumption, our way of life, should not trigger deforestation and forest degradation. In fact, this should go for everyone. We have to break the link.  Your report and the legislative initiative resolution which this House will adopt tomorrow is an extremely important contribution in this regard. We particularly appreciate that through this report, the European Parliament has been truly effective in drawing attention to the issue of deforestation. Public awareness and support are crucial if we really want to change things. The report addresses highly relevant issues and contains a number of important messages. It is certainly true that the limited uptake of voluntary schemes failed – failed to deliver on the promise of reducing deforestation – and that mandatory action is needed. Getting the product scope right and ensuring that it is scientifically based and regularly updated will definitely be a key aspect of any future action. It is also true that we should not forget that high carbon stock and biodiversity rich ecosystems, other than forest, marine and coastal ecosystems, wetlands, peatlands or savannas are equally threatened.  Let me be clear, we are determined to act and to use the EU’s economic weight to help protect, restore and sustainably manage the world’s forests. As you probably know, we have already started preparatory work on a new legislative proposal to curtail the placing of products associated with deforestation or forest degradation on the European market. This objective is enshrined in the European Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and farm—to—fork strategy. We are currently working on an impact assessment and we have launched a public consultation that will run until 10 December. The adoption of this proposal is currently scheduled for next year, 2021, the second quarter.  In the current impact assessment process and in line with our better regulation principle, we are of course assessing a variety of policy options. These include due diligence and bilateral agreements with third countries, but not only. We are, for example, studying the system put in place by the EU regulation to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, as well as different forms of verification systems, among other options. In parallel, we are also conducting a fitness check of the rules in place to fight illegal logging, namely the EU timber regulation and the FLEGT regulation, to take action into account of our past experience and better understand what has worked and what has failed. We expect to finalise these fitness checks in early 2021, so that their results can duly inform the decision—making process. We have been implementing the due diligence system of the EU timber regulation for more than seven years and have been negotiating and implementing flexible, voluntary partnership agreements for much longer.  Let me be clear, we will certainly not shy away from proposing strong mandatory action to address the problem, but we need to make sure that whatever we propose works, that it has the necessary impact on the ground and that it is compatible with our WTO obligations.  Let me conclude by saying that the report of the European Parliament constitutes an important contribution and goes beyond the legislative work of the Commission, meaning it should also translate in the work of other sectors, including working in partnership with producing countries to reduce pressures on forest and help them implement sustainable forest—based value chains – ones adopted by this House. We will carefully analyse your recommendations and will duly consider these when developing our proposal. Honourable Members, between 1990 and 2020, about 10% of the world’s forest cover was destroyed – an area bigger than India. If deforestation were a nation, it would be the third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the US. We cannot underestimate this challenge, and we have to act. This is also why our efforts to curtail the risk of deforestation and forest degradation feature prominently in the Commission’s work programme for the next year, which the College adopted only two days ago. It is our responsibility to do our part to change this course and it is in our hands to do it effectively, already in upcoming months. Let us not waste this unique opportunity. Let us do this together.

Your report and the legislative initiative resolution which this House will adopt tomorrow is an extremely important contribution in this regard. We particularly appreciate that through this report, the European Parliament has been truly effective in drawing attention to the issue of deforestation. Public awareness and support are crucial if we really want to change things. The report addresses highly relevant issues and contains a number of important messages. It is certainly true that the limited uptake of voluntary schemes failed – failed to deliver on the promise of reducing deforestation – and that mandatory action is needed. Getting the product scope right and ensuring that it is scientifically based and regularly updated will definitely be a key aspect of any future action. It is also true that we should not forget that high carbon stock and biodiversity rich ecosystems, other than forest, marine and coastal ecosystems, wetlands, peatlands or savannas are equally threatened. Let me be clear, we are determined to act and to use the EU’s economic weight to help protect, restore and sustainably manage the world’s forests. As you probably know, we have already started preparatory work on a new legislative proposal to curtail the placing of products associated with deforestation or forest degradation on the European market. This objective is enshrined in the European Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and farm—to—fork strategy. We are currently working on an impact assessment and we have launched a public consultation that will run until 10 December. The adoption of this proposal is currently scheduled for next year, 2021, the second quarter. In the current impact assessment process and in line with our better regulation principle, we are of course assessing a variety of policy options. These include due diligence and bilateral agreements with third countries, but not only. We are, for example, studying the system put in place by the EU regulation to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, as well as different forms of verification systems, among other options. In parallel, we are also conducting a fitness check of the rules in place to fight illegal logging, namely the EU timber regulation and the FLEGT regulation, to take action into account of our past experience and better understand what has worked and what has failed. We expect to finalise these fitness checks in early 2021, so that their results can duly inform the decision—making process. We have been implementing the due diligence system of the EU timber regulation for more than seven years and have been negotiating and implementing flexible, voluntary partnership agreements for much longer. Let me be clear, we will certainly not shy away from proposing strong mandatory action to address the problem, but we need to make sure that whatever we propose works, that it has the necessary impact on the ground and that it is compatible with our WTO obligations. Let me conclude by saying that the report of the European Parliament constitutes an important contribution and goes beyond the legislative work of the Commission, meaning it should also translate in the work of other sectors, including working in partnership with producing countries to reduce pressures on forest and help them implement sustainable forest—based value chains – ones adopted by this House. We will carefully analyse your recommendations and will duly consider these when developing our proposal. Honourable Members, between 1990 and 2020, about 10% of the world’s forest cover was destroyed – an area bigger than India. If deforestation were a nation, it would be the third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the US. We cannot underestimate this challenge, and we have to act. This is also why our efforts to curtail the risk of deforestation and forest degradation feature prominently in the Commission’s work programme for the next year, which the College adopted only two days ago. It is our responsibility to do our part to change this course and it is in our hands to do it effectively, already in upcoming months. Let us not waste this unique opportunity. Let us do this together.","Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me start by thanking this Parliament for its valuable work and for its continuous support to address what has become one of the main threats to our planet – global deforestation. Let me congratulate you, Ms Burkhardt, and the entire Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on your important report, which calls for an EU legal framework to halt and reverse EU—driven global deforestation.

Paulo Rangel ,PPE," The application submitted by Austria for the intervention of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) relates to 2 338 redundancies, of which 502 are targeted for assistance, at 706 enterprises in NACE Revision 2 Division 49 (‘land transport and transport via pipelines’) in the NUTS II regions of Niederösterreich and Oberösterreich, during the reference period from 1 February 2010 to 31 October 2010. This application is related to the decrease in the freight business in Austria of 30-50% in July 2009, as a result of the crisis and its impact on the consumption and production of goods. According to the Commission’s assessment, this application meets all of the legally established eligibility criteria. Indeed, EGF involvement in situations like this is provided for in the EGF Regulation, in which, as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis, there are ‘at least 500 redundancies over a period of nine months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises, in a NACE 2 division in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II level’. I therefore voted for this resolution, in the hope that the assistance will be made available to the workers who have been made redundant swiftly and efficiently.","The application submitted by Austria for the intervention of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund relates to 2 338 redundancies, of which 502 are targeted for assistance, at 706 enterprises in NACE Revision 2 Division 49 in the NUTS II regions of Niederösterreich and Oberösterreich, during the reference period from 1 February 2010 to 31 October 2010.

João Ferreira ,GUE/NGL," We agree with the creation of a strategy for the Danube Region, based on an earlier consultation and cooperation between the countries and regions that are located along its course. Such a strategy will promote economic and social cohesion in those regions and promote territorial cohesion without jeopardising any of them. The strategy calls for improvements to the ecological status of the Danube, along with the development of a comprehensive plan for conserving and restoring the natural stocks. Furthermore, it proves to be a positive strategy in the proposal for improving the Danube’s multicultural environment, cultural dialogue and protecting its cultural and historical heritage. As stated in the report, we believe that implementation of this strategy must not impinge on the responsibilities of regional and local government, being based instead on cooperation between the countries and areas within this region.","We agree with the creation of a strategy for the Danube Region, based on an earlier consultation and cooperation between the countries and regions that are located along its course.

Sophia in ’t Veld ,ALDE,"Madam President, after every attack, like everybody else, I feel grief, shock, horror, and anger at the murderers. I also feel mounting frustration because what follows is a familiar ritual by now. First, we get a lot of solemn statements about our shared values (but quite frankly, I have heard some statements here that make me doubt whether we have shared values). Then we hear a lot of solemn statements about democratic values, fundamental rights and the rule of law. Much of this is lip service, because a raft of new measures is announced after every single attack, but their effectiveness is doubtful. The Council and Commission have so far refused an evaluation on the basis of Article 7, as requested by this House. Maybe now they will finally do it. Implementation of the measures by the Member States is patchy and inadequate. Then there is a near obsession with electronic mass surveillance – whereas what is needed is much more investment in human intelligence, in people on the ground who know what is going on in the banlieues and in Molenbeek. Why do we tolerate the existence of ghettos in our cities that are no-go areas for the police – where the police do not even dare to get out of their cars – so they cannot know what is going on? Let us start investing in human intelligence. Lastly, with regard to the passenger name record (PNR) proposal, I am asking the Council and the Commission to stop the campaign of lies. It is a lie to suggest that this House, or even – as is sometimes claimed – the centre-left groups in it, are blocking a PNR system. We have voted, we are committed, we are working on this issue: but commitment does not mean a blank cheque, ok? This is democracy: we are entitled to our views. We are negotiating, and now it is for the Council to move.

Mário Centeno,N/A,"Mr President, Mr President of the European Commission, Mr President of the European Central Bank, dear Jean-Claude Trichet, honourable Members of the European Parliament. It is a pleasure to join you today to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the launch of the euro. The euro is one of the greatest achievements in the history of European integration. Our single currency provides a solid anchor for the creation of jobs and growth across Europe.  The euro has become a symbol of the European identity. It became a popular idea among 340 million people in 19 euro-area countries as it enjoys greater support today than ever before. As the world’s second most-used currency, it reinforces Europe’s presence on the global scene. Many predicted a spectacular failure of the euro, but we proved them wrong.  Not all of the past 20 years have indeed been easy. The financial and sovereign debt crises have put the single currency to the test. Shortcomings in the architecture of the Economic and Monetary Union came to the surface. Still, the single currency emerged stronger from the crises, thanks to committed national policy action and major improvements in the euro area’s institutional framework.  The establishment of the European Stability Mechanism and the banking union has strengthened economic policy coordination, which illustrates precisely this point. Today the euro area is enjoying a broad-based economic expansion, which started in 2013. The outlook is positive. Despite some loss of momentum and some downside risks that have been accumulating. Steady job creation has allowed increasingly more people to benefit from this expansion. The health of public finances and of the banking sector has also been improving. Much has been achieved during these 20 years. Nevertheless, more is needed to ensure that the euro area is well equipped to handle future crises. The Eurogroup has been doing its part. Its work paved the way for an agreement at the December Euro Summit on strengthening our single currency. This was the single biggest reform of the euro performed outside the crisis context. The agreement will allow for a more effective and broader use of the European Stability Mechanism and make our system of bank resolution more credible. Importantly, leaders also agreed to establish a euro area budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness. I believe this project can, in time, go a long way towards making the euro stable and inclusive. The work on this file is our priority in the months ahead, but the Eurogroup will continue working on other important issues, such as the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and liquidity in resolution. Step by step, we are increasing the resilience and the smooth functioning of the currency union. Euro area countries and their citizens will thus be in a better position to reap the benefits of the single currency for the next 20 years and beyond.  We cannot repeat it often enough that the euro is not – and never was – an end in itself. It is a tool, intended to increase the prosperity of the peoples of Europe. It is our responsibility to ensure that it lives up to its promise, and even more so in these uncertain times. It is our task to generate a more prosperous society, a more inclusive society, a society with less inequality within each Member State and between our Member States. I just wish to leave you today with the desire to say ‘long live the euro, long live a stronger euro’. Thank you for your attention.

Mariya Nedelcheva,PPE," Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Iotova, for her fine, comprehensive report. Mr Diamandouros, your job is of paramount importance in terms of strengthening citizens’ trust in our institutions because we must never lose sight of the principle of good administration, and we must never take success for granted, stop striving and work even harder for our citizens. This is precisely why the reports on the European Ombudsman’s annual activities are of such great significance in terms of improving the work of our institutions for the benefit of Europe’s citizens. I would like to draw your attention to a few points. First of all, 2010 marked the re-election of Mr Diamandouros as European Ombudsman, the institution’s 15th anniversary, a new look for the annual report and a new strategy. All of this highlights the considerable experience that has been acquired and the desire to make progress. I would like to mention the reduction in the number of complaints compared with the 2009 figure, as well as the continuing trend for a large proportion of the complaints to relate to the transparency of and access to information. We should not forget the importance of transparency. Transparency is the rule, but confidentiality the exception. The Lisbon Treaty also equipped the European Ombudsman with another important instrument: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which became legally binding in the majority of Member States, and the right to good administration acquired legal value. The European Ombudsman should make the most of this new, sound legal basis to carry out his job successfully. Good cooperation with the new European External Action Service and the European Council is also so vital. It is important for the European Ombudsman to continue to support the activities of the European Network of Ombudsmen, and for us to continue setting up a comprehensive database. This is so that European citizens are better informed about the distribution of responsibilities between the European Ombudsman, the national ombudsmen and our Committee on Petitions, because we are all defending the interests of Europe’s citizens and bear responsibility for strengthening trust in Europe’s institutions.","Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Iotova, for her fine, comprehensive report. Mr Diamandouros, your job is of paramount importance in terms of strengthening citizens’ trust in our institutions because we must never lose sight of the principle of good administration, and we must never take success for granted, stop striving and work even harder for our citizens. This is precisely why the reports on the European Ombudsman’s annual activities are of such great significance in terms of improving the work of our institutions for the benefit of Europe’s citizens. I would like to draw your attention to a few points. First of all, 2010 marked the re-election of Mr Diamandouros as European Ombudsman, the institution’s 15th anniversary, a new look for the annual report and a new strategy. All of this highlights the considerable experience that has been acquired and the desire to make progress. I would like to mention the reduction in the number of complaints compared with the 2009 figure, as well as the continuing trend for a large proportion of the complaints to relate to the transparency of and access to information. We should not forget the importance of transparency. Transparency is the rule, but confidentiality the exception. The Lisbon Treaty also equipped the European Ombudsman with another important instrument: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which became legally binding in the majority of Member States, and the right to good administration acquired legal value. The European Ombudsman should make the most of this new, sound legal basis to carry out his job successfully. Good cooperation with the new European External Action Service and the European Council is also so vital. It is important for the European Ombudsman to continue to support the activities of the European Network of Ombudsmen, and for us to continue setting up a comprehensive database. This is so that European citizens are better informed about the distribution of responsibilities between the European Ombudsman, the national ombudsmen and our Committee on Petitions, because we are all defending the interests of Europe’s citizens and bear responsibility for strengthening trust in Europe’s institutions.","Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Iotova, for her fine, comprehensive report.

Roberta Metsola,N/A,"We now come to the order of business. The final draft agenda as adopted by the Conference of Presidents on 28 April pursuant to Rule 157 has been distributed. First of all, I would like to inform you that I have received one request for urgent procedure from the ENVI Committee pursuant to Rule 163 on the following legislative file: Transitional rules for the packaging and labelling of veterinary medicinal products. The vote on this request will be taken tomorrow. Next, with the agreement of the political groups, I wish to put to the House the following proposal for changes to the final draft agenda. Since the President of the European Council will not be present in Strasbourg, this item, scheduled as the first item in the afternoon of Tuesday, will not take place. Then on Wednesday, the vote on the report by Mr Hansen on distortive foreign subsidies is brought forward to Wednesday, and the debate on this report, scheduled for the afternoon, is removed from the agenda. The deadlines on this are: amendments or rejection, Tuesday, 3 May at noon; split and separate votes: Tuesday, 3 May at 19.00. We were also informed that the Council cannot be present for the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the state of play of the EU-Moldova cooperation taking place Thursday morning, and therefore the debate is changed into a Commission statement. If there are no objections, then this change is deemed approved. Also for Wednesday, the PPE Group has asked that a Commission statement on the call for the submission of a legislative proposal on a European lend-lease regulation be added as the second item on Wednesday afternoon.

Dita Charanzová,ALDE,"Mr President, I would point out to the Commissioner that more and more citizens are interested in international agreements: from trade to judicial cooperation agreements, to political declarations, and to the negotiations themselves. In my 12 years of working on international trade, I have never seen such active interest. We, the European Parliament, represent the people of Europe, and if we want to serve our citizens well we must be fully informed. Commissioner, the Treaties are very clear in this regard. The European Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed at all stages of international agreements. There are no conditional clauses in that sentence. As the guardian of the Treaties, the Commission must fulfil this requirement. Moreover, the framework agreement sets out clearly how this is to be done: Parliament must be informed by the Commission at the same time as the Council, before a mandate is given, during the negotiation and once an agreement is initialled or signed. Again, the wording in the framework agreement on this point is unconditional. It is a requirement. Yet, to this day, we seem to be treated as a second-class institution vis-à-vis the Council. Commissioner, Parliament must be treated on an equal footing with the Council. There can be no transparency if we learn of items only after the Council has voiced its opinions. The Commission’s agenda must not be set in accordance with the Council’s agenda alone. All that said, Commissioner, my Group also understands that this must be a two-way street: with greater transparency comes greater responsibility. Leaks, lies and mis-information can destroy the work of years in a single day. The European Parliament has rights but also obligations – and that too is clear in the framework agreement. We, as a Parliament, must respect the rules of secrecy of documents in order to preserve our mutual trust with the Commission, and respect their decisions on the level of secrecy attached to negotiation documents. My Group knows that rights come with responsibilities: responsible transparency means respecting the rules of the game. In particular, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Malmström on the excellent job she has done so far to push for, and lead, this transparency initiative in the area of trade. The reason I mention the transparency initiative in the trade sector is because I believe that this model could serve as an inspiration in other domains in which the EU negotiates with third countries. Let me give you another example: the recent deal that the Commission concluded with Turkey on the migration crisis. We all knew that it happened, when it happened and what the key points of it were. But the information was not complete: we were left with a lot of question marks, with information coming instead from the media. So I hope you will treat us as an equal partner in the coming years.

Barry Andrews,ALDE," – Madam President and Commissioner, it’s important at times like these to remind ourselves of the humanitarian principles, that is the obligation on humanitarian organisations to demonstrate independence, impartiality, humanity and neutrality, to deliver aid to the places where it’s needed most and to be completely neutral in armed conflict. The reasons for this are to ensure that aid gets to the people who need it most, but also to protect humanitarian workers. But it is relevant in the context of this debate, because humanitarian organisations are relied upon to create humanitarian corridors, but also to access prisoners of war on both sides of a conflict. We know that’s not happening right now. We don’t get the information we need because Russia has no respect whatsoever for humanitarian principles or international humanitarian law. So that’s why we need to have a discussion with humanitarian organisations so they can set out to us here in the European Parliament, or our committees, exactly what steps they have been taking to try to access the two million children that have been deported out of Ukraine into Russia. We need to hear exactly their evidence. The second thing we need to do is not to cut our humanitarian aid budget.

Um das zu ermöglichen – einen grenzüberschreitenden Rettungsdienst –, brauchen wir, zumindest in dem Fall meiner Grenzregion, sehr komplizierte Staatsverträge.

A leginkább rászoruló személyeket támogató európai segítségnyújtási alap szabályainak sürgős eljárásban való módosítása fontos: a járvány és a távolságtartás szabályai miatt új módot kell találni az élelmiszerek kiosztására; az emberek nem gyűlhetnek össze egy ingyen konyhán, mint korábban. Változtatni kell a segítség célba juttatásán: egységcsomagok kiszállítása vagy utalványok osztása most jobb módszer. Egyes országokban (hazámban is) azonban az elektronikus utalványok osztása nem célravezető: szükség van rugalmasságra és a tagállami sajátosságokhoz igazodásra. Az ételosztáshoz jelenleg megfelelő védőfelszerelés is szükséges: üdvözlöm, hogy az alap az élelmiszer és alapvető anyagi támogatás osztásán felül a járvány elleni védőfelszerelések osztására is használható lesz, ráadásul átmenetileg 100%-os EU-finanszírozással.

Reagálni kell a mindennapi kihívásokra és nem csak elméletben, hanem életszerűen. A leginkább rászoruló személyeket támogató európai segítségnyújtási alap szabályainak sürgős eljárásban való módosítása fontos: a járvány és a távolságtartás szabályai miatt új módot kell találni az élelmiszerek kiosztására; az emberek nem gyűlhetnek össze egy ingyen konyhán, mint korábban. Változtatni kell a segítség célba juttatásán: egységcsomagok kiszállítása vagy utalványok osztása most jobb módszer. Egyes országokban azonban az elektronikus utalványok osztása nem célravezető: szükség van rugalmasságra és a tagállami sajátosságokhoz igazodásra. Az ételosztáshoz jelenleg megfelelő védőfelszerelés is szükséges: üdvözlöm, hogy az alap az élelmiszer és alapvető anyagi támogatás osztásán felül a járvány elleni védőfelszerelések osztására is használható lesz, ráadásul átmenetileg 100%-os EU-finanszírozással.

Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy ,ALDE," Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for his excellent report. It is an important report. We have a saying in Dutch that translates as ‘knowledge through measuring’: precise data as the basis for further decisions. Let us not pull the political wool over our eyes, though. We have known for a long time what we have to do. We need to temporarily halt fishing for bluefin tuna. I witnessed in person the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) debacle in March, where a divided European Union was totally incapable of influencing the end result. Led by Japan, the international community decided against imposing a trade ban on bluefin tuna. The argument was that the place to do that was not CITES but the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). We shall have the opportunity to take it to that arena in Paris in November. My question to the Commission is as follows. Is Europe committed – as I would be – to achieving a temporary fishing ban, a zero quota, within the framework of ICCAT? Also, is the Commission prepared to adopt that position very quickly? That way, we would avoid repeating the mistake we made with CITES, namely adopting a position only at the very last minute and no longer being in a position to convince the rest of the world of our stance. I should like to put a very specific question to the Commissioner, therefore. When will you be adopting a position for the ICCAT meeting? Will it involve a zero quota and, if so, will you be launching a strong lobby within the international community to make this zero quota a reality?","Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for his excellent report.

Dita Charanzová,ALDE,"on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam President, Mr Commissioner, Europe is facing a turning point. After years of growth success based on free trade, we are seeing two of the world’s largest economies setting out a vision based on subsidies by national acts. So which way do we go? Do we follow or do we stick to the status quo? Clearly we need to find a third way, European way. We need a united European solution which protects the single market while supporting critical sectors and European supply chains. Europe cannot afford a national subsidies race both outside but also within Europe itself. We must act together to protect our businesses and to protect European jobs, and we must do so quickly. This is why Europe will act. The key, however, is that we must act in a way that supports both an open Europe based on open trade with like—minded nations, and that supports our businesses in these times of crisis and transformation. Temporarily, this might include European financial support. However, we must do even more. We want items made in Europe, but we want them to be made here because the business environment, our educated workers and our regulations make businesses want to grow here. We do not want business to take subsidies and once subsidies end to leave. Therefore Renew Europe believes we need European support for critical European sectors which support our companies in all Member States equally, which prevents the fragmentation of the single market. But any new European strategy must go beyond money alone. Europe will and must act to defend growth and jobs in Europe. But let’s get this right: millions of Europeans are counting on us.","on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam President, Mr Commissioner, Europe is facing a turning point.

Mick Wallace,GUE/NGL," – Madam President, Ireland would have liked Britain to stay in the European Union, but I think it’s very important that the vote of the people of Britain in 2016 was respected. We voted ‘No’ to Nice, and we voted ‘No’ to Lisbon; it was deemed the wrong answer, and they made us vote again.  Well, as it turned out, the truth be told, the British people voted again as well in the election last month and if Jeremy Corbyn had stuck to his own principles – who has been very anti neo-liberal for a long time – if he had actually stuck to his guns and stood up to the Blairites in his own party, you know what, he wouldn’t have got the hammering he got, because the British people had already spoken.

Francisco Guerreiro,Greens/EFA,"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, dear colleagues, dear Commissioner, these 2023 guidelines were impacted by the horrific developments in Ukraine, and in total support we adapted the text and opened the door to further economic support and to the reconstruction of the country. This collective work was led by Ştefănuță, whom I salute. Together we were able to reach a balanced text that we can support. This text includes many of my Group’s priorities, like climate and biodiversity protection in the EU, but also throughout the world, where Europe should lead and fund concrete actions to tackle climate change and to protect the Earth’s biodiversity. There are other areas where we achieved a good final text, like gender mainstreaming, rule of law, foreign affairs, humanitarian aid, and a good ambition on the funding of key EU agencies that really need to be supported, like, for example, the European Environment Agency and the European Institute for Gender Equality. But I would like to however highlight a passage in paragraph 6 that states that the EU should strengthen its energy security and autonomy and develop further the Energy Union via interconnectivity between Member States. Although I agree and we agree with this overall principle, we should refrain from using this energy independence needs to once again subsidise the fossil fuels industry, an area that has led us into a very dangerous and sustainable current situation. However, as I stated, this is a good compromise text that will influence the Commission to propose a pragmatic draft budget that hopefully will lead to a concrete 2023 budget that is as green, sustainable and powerful as it should be.","on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, dear colleagues, dear Commissioner, these 2023 guidelines were impacted by the horrific developments in Ukraine, and in total support we adapted the text and opened the door to further economic support and to the reconstruction of the country.

Sławomir Witold Nitras ,PPE," I would like to thank Mr Feio for his work on the draft report. It seems to me that we are returning to business as usual rather too quickly as far as the threats facing Europe are concerned. We are not giving proper attention to the warning signals from the financial markets, or from people such as President Trichet, who indeed called the Commission proposal a good but inadequate step towards strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact. Our role today, as the European Parliament, is to defend the European Commission’s proposals against the governments of the Member States which have not, apparently, learned any lessons from the crisis. If the European Council had properly adhered to the provisions of the pact, the scale of the European crisis in public finances would have been much smaller. If, today, we allow governments and, in particular, the governments of Germany and France, to water down the Commission’s proposals, the crisis will deepen, and we will have to wonder whether the entire common currency project has any point in its current form, and whether we will inadvertently prove that the euro was a failed experiment. Parliament faces a major task. We must defend the euro, and oppose any short-term political aims. We must force all Member States to conduct responsible budgetary policies, painful though it may be.

Nu zijn zoon de macht heeft overgenomen en hardhandig vreedzame protesten heeft stilgelegd, moeten er zo snel mogelijk vrije en eerlijke verkiezingen worden georganiseerd in aanwezigheid van internationale waarnemers. De EU moet Tsjaad blijven steunen in de strijd tegen jihadisme in de Sahelregio, in de strijd tegen radicale islam.  Maar laat mij duidelijk zijn, het land mag zeker de democratische waarden en mensenrechten niet verloochenen. We mogen niet toelaten dat de Sahel een brandhaard wordt, want de vonken daarvan zullen snel overslaan naar Europa. Daarom moet er meer ingezet worden op beleid in de Sahellanden en moet meer aandacht worden besteed aan deze regio, om zo de rekruteringsbodem voor de jihadisten weg te nemen.

Elżbieta Katarzyna Łukacijewska ,PPE," Last month unemployment in Europe topped the 25 million mark for the first time, and almost 80 million Europeans are threatened with poverty and social exclusion. In some countries this percentage is mainly made up of individuals aged between 18 and 24. The situation is really very difficult, and so the creation of new jobs is one of the most important priorities of the European Union. The key issues for the development of Europe appear to be to increase employment, especially among young people, to make it easier to transfer from education to work, to invest in enterprise and to promote and facilitate the establishment of people’s own business ventures. One way in which this will be made possible is through the Social Investment Pact, which I voted in favour of today. This Pact envisages a series of actions aimed at increasing the competitiveness of European workers, a significant increase in the number of new jobs for young people through, for example, the introduction of incentives for employers to employ graduates and the creation of good conditions for the development of businesses. Thank you very much.","Last month unemployment in Europe topped the 25 million mark for the first time, and almost 80 million Europeans are threatened with poverty and social exclusion.

Glenis Willmott ,S&D,"Madam President, the President of the Commission talked about sustainable growth and a target of 75% employment across the EU, a goal we would all agree with. Yet across the EU, drastic cuts in public services are adding to the numbers of unemployed, taking money out of the economy and reducing essential services. How does this help the economy and avoid a job crisis? It really does not make sense. It puts the recovery at risk, a risk that is being taken, by the way, in my own country, the UK, by the Cameron Government. Maintaining investment in areas the EU has a potential to lead in, such as renewable energies and high-speed rail, will help create the Europe we want, it will help create the Europe we need, and it will help secure the economy. Finally, we need to guarantee overseas aid budgets, which are actually seen by some as an easy target. Those countries that fall short, far short, of their target pledges, should be strongly encouraged to rethink this disastrous policy.","Madam President, the President of the Commission talked about sustainable growth and a target of 75% employment across the EU, a goal we would all agree with.

In addition, the people are being harassed by criminal groups, who are plundering abandoned shops and houses.

It is good that we have decided to send EUR 3 million for the most immediate needs. We should, however, remember that there are still places in Chile which have not been reached by aid, because of the damage sustained to roads and bridges. The recent events in Chile and Haiti demonstrate that, as well as financial aid from the European Union, the mechanisms of giving aid to countries hit by disasters still need improvement.

Sabine Verheyen ,PPE,"Herr Präsident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Ich begrüße die Strategie der Kommission zum digitalen Binnenmarkt ausdrücklich. Sie ist ein guter erster Aufschlag, die europäischen Regulierungen an die Realitäten der heutigen technischen Entwicklungen anzupassen. Sie muss aber in vielen Bereichen vertieft und konkretisiert werden. Der digitale Binnenmarkt ist essentiell für die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung der Europäischen Union, birgt aber ein ebenso großes Potenzial zum Erhalt und zur Verbreitung kultureller kreativer Inhalte. Das Internet hat die Art und Weise, wie und wo wir Inhalte konsumieren, radikal verändert. Deshalb müssen die rechtlichen Voraussetzungen an die technologischen Veränderungen so angepasst werden, dass der legale Zugang zu Online-Inhalten auch grenzüberschreitend oder aus dem Ausland vereinfacht wird. Allerdings muss hier mit besonderem Augenmaß vorgegangen werden. Für einige europäische künstlerische und kreative Sektoren ist das Territorialprinzip der Kern ihrer Finanzierungsstrukturen und somit die Voraussetzung für Vielfalt in der Kreativität, für die Produktion neuer europäischer Inhalte, gerade für kleinere und mittlere Produzenten, für spezielle kulturelle Filme, die an ihren jeweiligen Markt adäquat angepasst sind. Wir müssen eine ausgewogene Position zwischen den durch das Urheberrecht geschützten Rechten und der Nachfrage der Verbraucher finden, digitale Inhalte über nationale Grenzen hinweg zu konsumieren. Ich stimme der Kommission zu: Portabilität ist unerlässlich, aber ohne die wirtschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen für eine professionelle Erstellung von kreativen Inhalten zu zerstören. Eine völlige Abschaffung des Territorialprinzips in jedem Bereich würde die europäische kulturelle Vielfalt massiv gefährden. Die Folge wäre eine Konzentration auf einige große Produzenten und Mainstream-Angebote, die wir sicherlich nicht wünschen. Deshalb müssen wir hier mit besonderer Sorgfalt vorgehen. Beim Thema AVMD möchte ich die Kommission auffordern, auch das Thema Plattformregulierung stärker mit einzubeziehen sowie Regulierungen im Bereich Zugang und Auffindbarkeit zu finden.

Die Vielfalt des kulturellen und audiovisuellen Angebots muss für alle europäischen Bürger zugänglich und auffindbar sein, insbesondere wenn durch Gerätehersteller, Netzbetreiber oder Inhalteanbieter schon eine Vorsortierung der angebotenen Inhalte vorgegeben wird.","Herr Präsident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Ich begrüße die Strategie der Kommission zum digitalen Binnenmarkt ausdrücklich. Sie ist ein guter erster Aufschlag, die europäischen Regulierungen an die Realitäten der heutigen technischen Entwicklungen anzupassen. Sie muss aber in vielen Bereichen vertieft und konkretisiert werden. Der digitale Binnenmarkt ist essentiell für die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung der Europäischen Union, birgt aber ein ebenso großes Potenzial zum Erhalt und zur Verbreit",nan

Mick Wallace,GUE/NGL," – Mr President, the Energy Charter Treaty is a relic of a fossil-fuel past and beyond reform. The EU is probably wasting its time by engaging in a reform process that isn’t going anywhere. The reforms will not be coherent with the Paris Agreement targets and the European Green Deal, for three main reasons: it won’t immediately end protection for all fossil fuel investments. At best, existing coal, gas and oil investments would continue to be protected well into the mid-2030s. Secondly, it won’t end the old investor-state dispute—settlement system. This is not even part of the negotiations. And thirdly, it won’t guarantee states’ rights to regulate by introducing effective limits to investors’ rights. Also, the proposals to include hydrogen and biomass in the list of energy technologies that are protected under the Treaty will only increase the risk of investor-state dispute—settlement challenges. The Energy Charter Treaty cannot be modernised or fixed, and the EU should withdraw from the Treaty.","– Mr President, the Energy Charter Treaty is a relic of a fossil-fuel past and beyond reform.

Marian-Jean Marinescu ,PPE," There are certain speakers in this Parliament who, regardless of the topic being discussed, talk on the same subject, not always in an appropriate manner. The first priority during the European Council meeting must obviously be to find a solution so that the Czech Republic can finalise the procedures for ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon. However, this solution must be a fair one for all the other Member States. At the same time, we must not forget the current economic crisis which we are still facing and which we must also find immediate solutions for. The economic and financial crisis, along with the special financial measures adopted last year, have destabilised in an alarming way the public finances of the majority of the European Union’s Member States. So far the Commission has 17 of the 27 Member States in its sights for having an excessive deficit, with estimates showing that another three Member States will soon be in the same situation. Regardless of their economic power, Member States have exceeded the figures committed to as the crisis has caused a sharp drop in budget revenue and growth beyond the public expenditure planned for. There are actually clear conditions for an economic recovery in the near future, which is why we can initiate the discussions on reducing the financial incentives in certain areas. However, we need to take into account the specific situation of each Member State separately and the European institutions must acknowledge that we are not yet at the point where public support can be waived completely for all economic sectors. Member States must agree on continuing the recovery strategy and on suitable instruments for supporting this, including stepping up structural reforms which may, in the medium term, reduce the fiscal deficit and naturally contribute to economic recovery. If the post-recovery period is not managed properly by Member States, it may destabilise the European Union’s internal market. Therefore, the decision in favour and permission to continue providing public support must be made based on the specific conditions from one state to the next.","There are certain speakers in this Parliament who, regardless of the topic being discussed, talk on the same subject, not always in an appropriate manner.

This appears to be a direct outgrowth of the eurosceptic attitude of the Cameron government. It shows what the British Government’s current European course is giving rise to. This is absolutely shameful. We do not expect our British friends to deliberately infect their local governments with a European anti-virus. Exchange between citizens and associations from all corners of Europe is one of the most concrete tools for shaping European citizenship on the ground. We are counting on British local councils to continue to respond loyally and enthusiastically to twinning projects.

Paul Tang,S&D," – Mr President, you have heard the position eloquently put by Jonás Fernández, and that is all true, but I would like to make a critical remark as well. Financial markets, and probably politicians too, frequently suffer from the same illness: short—sightedness. We don’t look ten or 20 years ahead, but only two or three. And this means we forego long term growth to get a quick win. And I’m reminded of this especially now while discussing the Regulation for European Long-Term Investment Funds. These funds are meant to incentivise a long-term view and increase investments to firms and projects that need time to grow. But they have struggled so far, right. Interest for financial markets from investors has been limited, because they care about the quick win. And ELTIFs by themselves will not square the circle of short-termism in the financial markets. Luckily enough, they are helped by the EU’s sustainable finance agenda. Like a pair of glasses, the taxonomy and disclosure regulations can counter short-sightedness. They help to clarify the important long-term sustainability risks faced by the funds and they provide direction of travel for the long term. It’s therefore unfortunate that an ELTIF update did so little to take these elements on board. If I invest in a long-term fund I expect to care about the long-term risks, such as climate risks, and work towards the long-term climate transition. And sadly, this will not be true. Instead, the regulation creates an environmentally sustainable ELTIF. This way, all green aspects have been grouped together and put in a new standard that I suspect will not gather much interest and will not be used. It’s a problem of short-sightedness. Put the green bit in a far corner and you can’t see it anymore. Still, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteur, Elisabetta Gualmini, for the good cooperation on this file and for the successful damage control. Sadly, on this file, the vision needed to really ingrain the long-termism in the financial markets was short in supply.","– Mr President, you have heard the position eloquently put by Jonás Fernández, and that is all true, but I would like to make a critical remark as well.

Evelyn Regner ,S&D," Mr President, today, before the vote on Ms Podimata’s report, is the time to speak plainly. A financial transaction tax is unavoidable. It is at the core of our exit strategy from the crisis. I emphasise that as the third Austrian in a row to speak in favour of the financial transaction tax. High-risk, poorly thought out financial speculation was one of the reasons why the huge financial, economic and now social crisis came about – if not its very cause. Banks are having to be rescued on a daily basis. The whole of Europe has been plunged into a deep crisis. Now, not sometime in the distant future, is the time to make the financial sector, which has lost touch with reality, shoulder its share of the responsibility. We pay taxes on everything imaginable: on labour, on energy. It is, in fact, absurd that the financial transaction tax has not yet been introduced. I expect the financial transaction tax to result in greater stability in the financial markets, a reduction in short-term speculation and, above all, greater focus on the real economy and the financing thereof.","Mr President, today, before the vote on Ms Podimata’s report, is the time to speak plainly.

Tiemo Wölken,S&D," – Frau Präsidentin, Herr Kommissar Timmermans! Wir reden heute über das „Fit für 55“-Paket, und alle seine Elemente sind wichtig; und diese Debatte wird nicht jedem Element gleich gerecht.  Lassen Sie mich eine große Gruppe von Menschen erwähnen, über die wir heute noch nicht gesprochen haben, die bei der Erreichung der Klimaziele von absoluter Wichtigkeit sind: Das sind die Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer, die dafür sorgen, dass CO2‑freie Produkte hergestellt werden, dass Industrien CO2-frei werden. Wir als Sozialdemokratische Fraktion wollen ganz einfach Industrie in der Europäischen Union halten und dafür sorgen, dass die Dekarbonisierung so schnell wie möglich vorangeht. Und genau das geht nur mit den Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmern. Im Umweltausschuss haben die liberalen Kollegen und die Kollegen von der EVP die Stärkung der Rechte der Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer im ETS-System leider abgelehnt. Ich hoffe, dass das bei der morgigen Abstimmung anders sein wird, denn wir brauchen für eine gerechte Transformation genau diese Menschen.  Wir haben daher vorgeschlagen, die Transformation in der Aus- und Weiterbildung stärker zu berücksichtigen. Wir wollen, dass die ETS-Einnahmen nicht nur den Unternehmen zugutekommen, sondern daraus auch die Einhaltung von Arbeitsstandards und Beteiligungsrechten finanziert wird. Und wir wollen, dass Beschäftigte bei der Umstrukturierung dringend mit einbezogen werden. Warum? Weil sie ein Interesse daran haben, ihren Arbeitsplatz zu behalten, und bessere Entscheidungen treffen als Unternehmen, die sozusagen nur auf shareholder value schauen. Und lassen Sie mich auch etwas zum ETS-2-System sagen. Nur auf Druck meiner Fraktion war es überhaupt möglich, dass wir ein ETS-2-System bekommen, das nicht sozialer Sprengstoff pur ist. Wir haben ein Kostenweitergabeverbot erreicht. Wir haben erreicht, dass private Haushalte später einbezogen werden, dass es eine Notbremse gibt. Das ETS-2-System, wie es vom Berichterstatter vorher vorgeschlagen worden war, wäre zu dieser Zeit sozialer Sprengstoff in der Europäischen Union gewesen. Mit dem Social Climate Fund, den die Europäische Kommission Gott sei Dank vorgeschlagen hat, stellen wir jetzt sicher, dass wir niemanden zurücklassen. Apropos niemanden zurücklassen: Das gilt auch für die Automobilindustrie. Es ist richtig, den Verbrenner für neue Fahrzeuge 2035 auslaufen zu lassen. Und es wäre falsch, auf synthetische Kraftstoffe zu setzen, die wir nicht haben, die viel zu teuer sind und die einen Transformationspfad suggerieren, den es nicht gibt. Let’s use our last chance.

Pero no es así. Hoy debatimos en el Pleno sobre los derechos de las mujeres en Polonia. Porque es debatir sobre los derechos de las mujeres. Porque es debatir sobre los derechos humanos.  La publicación de la sentencia del Tribunal Constitucional de Polonia y el respaldo del -Gobierno polaco supone la prohibición de facto del aborto. La decisión la toma un tribunal que no debería llamarse así, ya que está totalmente controlado por el partido Ley y Justicia, el del señor Kaczyński, que no respeta la separación de poderes. Y es una cuestión que este Parlamento debe tratar.  Tengamos en cuenta otra cosa. Con la prohibición del aborto no estamos consiguiendo acabar con esta práctica.

Siiri Oviir ,ALDE," Mr President, it is important that universal services should be available to all and that they should be more uniform throughout Europe. It is not acceptable to have large differences in quality and price between Member States, and concrete steps should be taken in order to level out those differences. There are, for instance, great differences in the area of e-services, Internet quality and price, so that in one Member State there is nearly a complete absence of decent e-services and the Internet is of poor quality and expensive. We must learn from each other’s experiences and achievements, and move towards a more uniform level of services. Despite some quality-related problems, the single European emergency number 112 is a good example in this area. I supported the adoption of this report.","Mr President, it is important that universal services should be available to all and that they should be more uniform throughout Europe.

Ivan Štefanec,PPE," – Madam President, 35 years ago, a very important event took place in Bratislava that changed the history of Czechoslovakia and Europe. This was the Candle Manifestation. Thousands of people peacefully protested against communist tyranny by praying with lit candles.

The European Parliament then adopted a special resolution condemning this brutality and calling for respect for the human rights of Christians. This significant event led to the Velvet Revolution and the fall of the Iron Curtain in Europe.

Zigmantas Balčytis ,S&D," I voted for this resolution which aims to limit the use in food products of food additives that are dangerous to health, in order to protect the health of consumers. Legislation currently in force in the European Union provides that food additives may be used if they benefit the consumer. As the benefit of thrombin (‘meat glue’) for consumers has not been proven and the process of binding together many separate pieces of meat significantly increases the risk of it being infected by bacteria, I did not support the proposal to allow this food additive to be used in bovine and pork products. In addition, we must strive to prevent such products processed with ‘meat glue’ from finding their way into public establishments serving food.","I voted for this resolution which aims to limit the use in food products of food additives that are dangerous to health, in order to protect the health of consumers.

Marie-Pierre Vedrenne,N/A,"rapporteure. – Madame la Présidente, chers collègues, vous êtes amenés à vous prononcer sur mon rapport sur le renforcement de la participation des citoyens à notre processus décisionnel, et c’est dans un contexte de guerre à nos frontières que vous êtes amenés à voter demain. Oui, la guerre est bien à nos frontières; des femmes et des hommes se battent pour préserver la démocratie en Ukraine et l’Union européenne doit se montrer digne de leur combat.  Notre rempart est la démocratie. Ce sont les valeurs qui nous unissent et les droits que les citoyens partagent, et il n’y a pas de démocratie sans les citoyens. Le courage des Ukrainiens, leur soif de liberté, leur amour de la démocratie rappellent avec force que l’Union européenne, symbole de paix, d’unité, de liberté, doit porter haut un modèle démocratique toujours plus enclin à la participation citoyenne, toujours plus intransigeant sur le respect de l’état de droit et toujours plus favorable à la transparence. Car il n’y a pas de démocratie sans participation active des citoyens, et la conférence sur l’avenir de l’Europe montre l’envie des citoyens de faire entendre leur voix, et ceci au-delà des élections. Leurs recommandations doivent être prises en compte. Sans résultats concrets, les citoyens vont s’éloigner encore plus de nos institutions. Et leur confiance, déjà érodée, c’est à nous, élus au Parlement européen, de la regagner.  Il est urgent de repenser les instruments participatifs et il nous faut travailler pour que tous les obstacles à la participation soient levés: barrières linguistiques, barrières technologiques... De refus de collaborer de la part de nos institutions, nous ne pouvons plus accepter. L’Union européenne doit être ambitieuse pour donner la parole à chacun, écouter et donner les moyens nécessaires pour s’impliquer. Notre démocratie, nous la renforcerons ainsi.  Pas de démocratie sans respect de l’état de droit. Nous ne pourrons faire aucun compromis. L’Union européenne est une communauté de valeurs et il n’y a pas de place pour les autocrates qui ne respectent pas l’état de droit. Ainsi, nous devons garantir une surveillance étroite des fonds européens dans nos États membres. Chaque citoyen doit pouvoir être assuré que les valeurs européennes sont respectées dans le cadre du plan de relance et en cela, le rôle du Médiateur est essentiel. Le Parlement européen lui a déjà montré son plein soutien pour assurer le respect de l’état de droit.  Enfin, pas de démocratie sans transparence.

Johan Van Overtveldt,ECR," – Voorzitter, vorige week bereikten we een historisch akkoord over de begroting 2020, historisch in de zin van een toekomstgerichte omslag naar investeringen in domeinen waar de EU wel degelijk een belangrijke meerwaarde kan bieden.

Die Ergebnisse des Rates der letzten Woche lassen nicht nur viele Fragen offen, sondern haben offensichtlich auch nichts zu der Lösung von einigen Problemen beitragen können und haben sogar ganz im Gegenteil in einigen Fragen den Status quo ante sogar verschlechtert. Mit der Diskussion um den Beitritt Nordmazedoniens und Albaniens zur Europäischen Union wurde im Rat eine Staats- und Regierungskrise in Nordmazedonien ausgelöst. Bei der Debatte um den mehrjährigen Finanzrahmen werden Zahlen hin- und hergeschoben, und wie die ambitionierten Klimaziele erreicht werden sollen, wissen einige der Staats- und Regierungschefs offenkundig selber nicht.

Mairead McGuinness,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I have really welcomed this debate, and I think we all agree that, if the current system worked, we wouldn’t be reviewing it. So I welcome your support for our July package. It’s really important that you work hard and fast on this proposal. I want to speak to some of the points that were raised. To Mr Beck, who I think is not in the Chamber, we are not abolishing, and have no intention to abolish, cash. Cash is king, but cash must be clean, and, as we’ve heard in this debate, there is a lot of dirty cash floating through our financial system in Europe, and it has got to stop.  Mr Kelleher referred to the truth behind the dirty money, which is crimes against society, against children, and against women. It is just an evil pursuit and we have got to stop criminals in their tracks. So this is not just a financial issue. This is a massive social issue that we have a responsibility to address. When it comes to the idea of the tools we have, yes, we will use, and are using, all of the tools available, as I outlined in my opening remarks. Specifically on beneficial ownership, we are looking very closely at the issue of beneficial ownership in a specific number of Member States, and we are vigilant. On crypto, as was referred to earlier, yes, this area is now non—transparent, and in our new proposals there will be transparency on the transactions.  So I deeply appreciate the debate here this evening and the passion you bring to it. This is a very important issue for us, and I want to assure you, as I said at the outset, not only will we implement the new proposals and work with you on them, we will continue to expect full implementation of existing rules in our Member States. But the truth is that the fight against money laundering is a global fight, and therefore it requires global action. I think this was particularly shown, again, by the Pandora Papers investigation. At this stage, it is still to be determined whether, besides tax evasion, crimes related to the illicit source of wealth are involved.  The Commission and Member States are working hard in the Financial Action Task Force to ensure that international standards are robust and up to date, including in the area of the transparency, as I have said, of beneficial ownership. This is a key area. But our anti-money laundering (AML) system is only as strong as its weakest link, and this is why we need more Europe in this area. We need more Europe to create bridges between supervisors, among financial intelligence units (FIUs) and between supervisors and FIUs, and we need bridges to ensure that the work carried out on the prevention side effectively feeds into the work of investigators, public prosecutors and asset recovery officers. Our goal is not only to prevent financial crime, but also to bring criminals to justice and deprive them of their illicit proceeds. I count on your full support in the future negotiations on our AML package. We will work hard and we will work fast, and, if successful, we will reduce and eliminate the crime of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. I believe we can do this together.

Pirkko Ruohonen-Lerner ,ECR,"Arvoisa puhemies, on julistettu, että Kreikan kriisi on päättynyt, vaikka velkaa on yli kolmesataa miljardia euroa. Heikko veronkanto ja laaja veronkierto ovat yhä suuria ongelmia.  Pääministeri Tsipras, sanoitte äsken, että olette onnistuneet torjumaan veronkiertoa. Kreikassa lomailleet ystäväni ovat kertoneet, kuinka heille on kaupoissa ja ravintoloissa usein ilmoitettu, että kassakone on rikki ja vain käteinen kelpaa.

Andris Piebalgs,N/A,"Madam President, let me first thank you for this opportunity to talk about the challenge of poverty and what the European Union can do on the global level through its development cooperation policy. In the second part of this statement, I will also turn to the report by Mrs Figueiredo. Eradicating poverty is the most pressing global challenge of our time. It is a challenge that must be tackled, not only for obvious reasons of solidarity and duty, but also for the sake of worldwide prosperity and stability. And that is in everybody’s interests. In 2000, world leaders gathered at the UN in New York and agreed on an international development agenda for the coming 15 years, the Millennium Development Goals. Among the different goals and targets set in the framework, the world committed to reduce extreme poverty by half. Where are we now, five years before the 2015 deadline? Encouraging progress has been achieved. Overall, 120 million people moved out of poverty between 2000 and 2005, which corresponds to an annual drop of 2.4%, but there is no time for complacency. Today, 1.4 billion people still live in extreme poverty, and there are huge disparities among regions, countries and population groups. Besides, the recent and current global crisis – from food and fuel price shocks to economic instability and climate change – threatens both past achievements and future prospects. Two weeks ago, the MDG summit confirmed the world’s ambition to fight against poverty. Members of the European Parliament, led by Gay Mitchell, made an important contribution to that summit and I thank them very much for their participation and support. I would also like to thank Parliament for its support in the whole preparation process ending with adoption of the Cashman report. This House’s continuing attention to the MDGs made the EU’s position strong and ambitious in New York. I think the MEPs who took part in the summit were reassured by the outcome. There was no blame game; rather, the gathering gave new energy, impetus and hope with regard to attaining the goals. It demonstrated that the MDGs are still high on the political agenda, with some 110 Heads of State or Government attending the summit. The European Union was instrumental in making this event a success by shaping and voicing a strong common approach among our 27 Member States. The fight against poverty is also high on our agenda in the European Union. This is part of our European project. It is a central objective of the European Union development policy, as stated in the Lisbon Treaty, and it is also something that European citizens firmly support, which is equally important. As the world’s leading donor, the European Union has made a major contribution to the achievement of the MDGs so far. To give you just two examples, the European Commission alone has helped put 9 million more girls and boys in schools since 2004, and we have connected 31 million households to clean drinking water. I believe this is something to be proud of, but we need to do more and we can do more. In June, Europe’s leaders helped make the MDGs stronger by agreeing on an ambitious plan and a set of actions. The plan prioritises action on the goals on which we have made the least progress, and in those regions and countries that are lagging furthest behind, including those experiencing conflict and fragility. The plan also confirms our commitment to meeting the 0.7% GNI target by 2050, despite the difficult economic and financial context. To achieve this, we need to assess progress on this every year. Turning the Millennium Development Goals – in particular, the goal relating to poverty eradication – into Millennium Development Realities by 2015 will also remain the overarching priority of my action. We all know that aid alone will not be sufficient to attain the MDGs. To meet the goals, it is also of paramount importance that we are more creative in enhancing the impact of our aid, in promoting more sustainable and more inclusive growth, and in mobilising other and additional sources of finance for development. Equally important are the quality and effectiveness of aid, including through more transparency and accountability, as well as ensuring that non-aid policies are more supportive of the MDGs. Development aid must be conceived as a catalyst, not as a cure. No country has ever been transformed by aid alone. Sustainable progress depends primarily on developing a country’s capacity to generate inclusive and sustainable growth. Development can only come from within developing countries, not from outside, and so it is on this ‘within’ that we must focus our development efforts. In the end, this is what the principle of ‘ownership’ means. In November, I plan to launch a Green Paper and public consultation to gather views on how to improve our policies and instruments to better act on the enabling factors for sustainable and inclusive growth in partner countries, thereby tackling the root causes of poverty, bringing strong added value to our development cooperation. I believe, as usual, that your contribution to this debate will be essential. I would like to thank Ms Figueiredo for her report on minimum income schemes. At the very heart of her report is the basic right of people to have sufficient resources to allow them to live in dignity. This is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It has inspired several recent Commission initiatives in the area of active inclusion, in particular, the 2008 Commission recommendation on active inclusion which was endorsed by Parliament and the Council. The recommendation sets out integrated active inclusion strategies based on three pillars – namely, inclusive labour markets, access to quality services and adequate income support. The Commission therefore welcomes this report. At the same time, we fully respect Member State competences as regards the design and functioning of social protection schemes in general and minimum income schemes in particular. Adequate income is a fundamental component in the fight against poverty for people who cannot work. It constitutes a necessary complement to inclusive labour markets, to combat poverty for people who can work. The report rightly reaffirms the basic principle of income support, which has to be both adequate and incentive-compatible. Member States are currently taking fiscal consolidation measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances. The Commission shares the view that these measures have to take account of the need to protect the most vulnerable members of society. The European Commission will present a European Platform against Poverty by the end of this year, setting out concrete measures to support Member States in reaching the target of lifting at least 20 million European citizens out of poverty by 2020.","Madam President, let me first thank you for this opportunity to talk about the challenge of poverty and what the European Union can do on the global level through its development cooperation policy.

Dino Giarrusso,NI," – Mr President, the Nutrition World Summit held in Japan last week was a crucial moment to discuss the future of food and nutrition at a global level. We all know nowadays how important nutrition is, but also how present is the malnutrition issue. For this reason we, as the EU, must commit on a three-strategy focus: health, food and resilience. 149 million children under five are stunted, 49 million are under weight, but another 40 million suffer obesity.  The EU must stand as leader for nutrition in all terms – know-how, sustainable and healthy consumption of resources, promotion of European diets such as the Mediterranean one – the Italian one – as good practices, and also an efficient programme directed at those areas where children don’t have access to food. We have an ambitious goal now. No more children dead. No more disease by malnutrition. No more waste of food. In 2021 it’s time to act, and not to talk anymore.","– Mr President, the Nutrition World Summit held in Japan last week was a crucial moment to discuss the future of food and nutrition at a global level.

Bastiaan Belder ,ID," I cannot endorse the Balzani report. The first reason is the call for the introduction of a type of EU tax. The second reason concerns the economic crisis and the painful interventions being undertaken by Member States. The EU, too, must make efforts to ensure that its budget does not continue to run out of control and that it carries out the necessary cuts. With this in mind, I advocate a dynamic approach to tackling the ever growing gap between annual appropriations and the amounts being paid out. Limiting appropriations would lead to payments and appropriations becoming more closely aligned. I realise that multiannual programmes which are coming to an end because of the 2007-2013 Multiannual Framework will entail an increase in payments. I propose in that regard that, where some increase in payments is inevitable, it is offset by significantly lower appropriations. This also applies to budget lines for which implementation is lagging behind. These measures provide a logical and persuasive step towards a more realistic budget in difficult economic times.","I cannot endorse the Balzani report.

Nor can I accept the Commission’s political interference in the internal decision-making process by supporting organisations that advocate accession in a country where, as the latest Eurobarometer shows, the majority of citizens believe that it would not be beneficial; this is not surprising if we consider the antisocial nature of current EU policy.","I abstained from this vote.

Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,Greens/EFA," – Madam President, it is important to remember that the majority of women and young people of the UK voted to stay in the European Union. 75% of 18-24-year-olds voted to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union. More specifically, 80% of women between the ages of 18 and 24 were against Brexit, and there is a reason for that. The European Union protects women’s rights to a great extent. Will the UK, out of Europe, give the same guarantees? The Scots, the northern Irish, the Welsh, by their citizens’ votes and also, these last two years, by their national parliaments have continued to express their attachment to the European Union. They now find themselves on the sidelines. The choices of these regional assemblies are not heard, and this is one of the major problems of Brexit. But there is another concern, a very strong one. Great Britain today is a country with a very deregulated economy and a very unequal society.  European directives on workers’ rights were the last bulwark for the most vulnerable part: women, minorities and young people. We Greens, regionalists and pirates will pay close attention to the situation of citizens’ rights in the aftermath. We are committed to protecting the rights of all Europeans living in Britain and British people living in the rest of Europe.","– Madam President, it is important to remember that the majority of women and young people of the UK voted to stay in the European Union. 75% of 18-24-year-olds voted to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union.

João Ferreira ,GUE/NGL," In general, we support the proposal to create a financial transaction tax; we have long been advocating it. Whether as an instrument that provides a certain amount of tax justice or as a tool for combating financial speculation, it is necessary, albeit insufficient on its own. However, we do have some reservations about, and disagree with, certain specific aspects of this proposal. Although these reservations and disagreements had no bearing on how we voted, they may strongly influence our position in the later stages of this debate, for example, in relation to managing the revenue to be collected with this tax. That issue falls outside the scope of this directive, but that did not stop the majority in Parliament from including it; that is unacceptable. We consider the principle of revenue from the tax replacing part of the national contributions to the EU budget, thereby reducing the Member States’ direct contributions, completely unacceptable. This principle will result in continued penury budgets, while relieving the burden on richer countries with higher GNI, including those with bigger transactions markets, thus undermining the redistributive function of the budget and, with it, the – never realised – principle of economic and social cohesion. We also disagree with the relatively favourable treatment given to derivatives, which are more prone to speculation.","In general, we support the proposal to create a financial transaction tax; we have long been advocating it.

Manfred Weber,PPE,"on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, debating the State of the Union means today the first focus on what the pandemic has brought. Not everything went well and smoothly, but all in all, Europe has managed the crisis well. No other continent has developed a vaccine of a better quality. No other continent has a higher vaccination rate. No other continent has shown more solidarity and willingness to help each other, and no other continent has provided other parts of the world with more vaccines than we have. All Europe is proud of our everyday heroes, the doctors and nurses, researchers and many others, and we thank them for their contribution. The crisis defence began in China. In Europe, we found the solutions. We can be proud about what Europeans achieved in the past. When we look now what is in front of us, there are two main issues. We are emerging stronger from the crisis, but this crisis has caused and left deep social and economic wounds. Many people fear for their existence, for their jobs. Only if we create jobs, then we can secure our prosperity and we can care about the weakest in our society and we will defend the European way of life. Alongside the Green Deal, we are thinking as EPP that now is also the time for a Jobs Deal. In addition to this, after Afghanistan, we now really need a common foreign and defence policy. Joe Biden is clear, the US is no longer a world policeman. But where is Europe? Russia and China are just waiting to fill the vacuum, and that would be fatal for the future. We would wake up in a world in which we and also our children will not want to live.  Based on these two points, I want to make very concrete proposals for what we have to do now. Firstly, the rapid development of a vaccine was only possible because the authorities worked quickly during the approval process. That is what the BioNTech founders told us; no blockades. But this speed is what we also need now in other fields of the research sector and in the investments for the climate protection. With an immediate action plan for cutting bureaucracies in the European Union, we should work together with all stakeholders to identify 300 EU regulations that we will abolish or simplify in the next 12 months. Secondly, for the production of an electric car, only half the number of employees is needed. Many industrial jobs in the European Union are under threat. New jobs are urgently needed in today’s European Union. International trade was and is a job machine. Why not now pick up this debate with our American friends? Let us negotiate an EU-US trade emergency programme on the mobility sector, on mechanical engineering in the digital economy as soon as possible, as a first step for a broader comprehensive trade agreement. And only this will be the way to strengthen the Western economy, key industrial sectors. And together we can protect ourselves against China. The European Union and the US together represent 50% of the global economy. Together, we can start the growth machine that benefits the whole world. Thirdly, the pandemic has shown us how important the health sector is. The coming decade will bring a wave of innovation in medicine. We can beat cancer. I want Europe to create 10 million new jobs in the next four years with an immediate innovation offensive in this field. At the beginning of the digitalisation 20 years ago, we, as Europeans, overslept the innovation on internet and jobs were created in the US and in China. Today, neither the Chinese nor the Americans are ahead with the COVID vaccines, but we are. So let us use our know-how right now. Fourthly, Defence. We and I fully welcome the initiatives from Ursula von der Leyen today and also the decision of the Defence Council in Ljubljana. But, what are we waiting for? The Lisbon Treaty gives us all options if we want to create a reaction force. So let’s do it and let us do it now.  Fifthly, Global responsibility. Some 15 000 children die of hunger worldwide every day. The everyday horror, and we hardly speak about it. The weakest suffer most from the COVID crisis. That is why we must reallocate and free up funds. Like we are doing in Afghanistan now. To invest, we need to stop the silent and daily mass deaths in this world.  Finally, without law and security, the rest means nothing. That is why we stand for a robust application of the rule of law mechanism inside of the European Union, but that is not enough. Cross-border tax fraud, money laundering and criminal organisations, mafia make its way through our societies, and the terrorist threat is still high in Europe. Why don’t we finally transform Europol into a real European FBI? The European Commission should present in the next 12 months a legislative package to strengthen security in the European Union. Ursula von der Leyen was clear that we can lead the world with the Green Deal. I want to put on the table that we have to have the same ambitions now for new jobs, for our international responsibility and for security.

Lara Comi ,PPE," Turkey is a strategic partner for the European Union. Apart from the – albeit important – direct trade between Turkey and our countries, it lies immediately outside our south-eastern borders, it is a member of the same defensive alliance as the majority of EU Member States and it allows us access to energy resources and raw materials. Moreover, the recent constitutional referendum marks a step towards its adoption of the acquis communautaire, and deserves due recognition. This report has the great merit of focusing on the most important aspect for the Union, and it highlights its crucial importance together with the positive elements. In particular, it shows how relations with this country are played out on many levels. It is difficult to sum up their complexity in a simple decision by these institutions for or against admissibility. All of these considerations form the basis with which to build Turkey’s path towards Europe, as well as providing a reason to regard Turkey as already being much closer than the treaties may lead us to believe. I think that it is appropriate to follow the line set out by the rapporteur, for the benefit of both parties.","Turkey is a strategic partner for the European Union. Apart from the – albeit important – direct trade between Turkey and our countries, it lies immediately outside our south-eastern borders, it is a member of the same defensive alliance as the majority of EU Member States and it allows us access to energy resources and raw materials. Moreover, the recent constitutional referendum marks a step towards its adoption of the acquis communautaire, and deserves due recognition.

Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy,ALDE,"Dank u, mevrouw de voorzitter. Ook ik wil de Commissie hartelijk danken voor dit uitstekende document en voor de uitstekende bijdrage aan dit debat. Dit is een van de eerste documenten waarin de Commissie aangeeft dat er dringend wat moet worden gedaan aan de veelzijdige ecologische crisis waar we mee te maken hebben. Klimaat, biodiversiteit, grondstoffen en luchtkwaliteit: het komt er allemaal in voor. Daar dank ik de Commissie echt voor. Zoals mijnheer Bullmann al zei, gaat er gelukkig ook aandacht uit naar de sociale ongelijkheid, want die twee gaan inderdaad heel erg samen. Maar dan komen we bij de grote vraag, dezelfde vraag die ik ook stelde na de presentatie van de langetermijnstrategie voor het klimaat. Hoe gaan we dit in concrete actie omzetten, niet alleen morgen, maar ook vandaag? Als ik kijk naar het voorstel voor de meerjarenbegroting en zie dat we daarin beleid en geld vastleggen tot en met 2027, dan doet dat ernstig gedateerd aan. Dat is oude politiek, als ik het vergelijk met deze twee uitstekende documenten van de Europese Commissie. Laten we wel zijn, 2030 lijkt ver weg, maar het is morgen. En we hebben nog maar heel weinig tijd om het tij te keren. Dus, mijn concrete vraag aan de Commissie is: wanneer kunnen wij concrete voorstellen verwachten? En kunnen wij aanpassingen van de meerjarenbegroting verwachten? Het landbouwbeleid zoals dat nu op tafel ligt, voldoet niet aan de criteria die in dit document worden gesteld. Waarom vergroenen wij niet alle openbare aanbestedingen zodat we een markt van meer dan 2 000 miljard euro per jaar creëren? Voor de structuurfondsen geldt hetzelfde als voor het landbouwbeleid: ze voldoen niet aan de criteria die we nu stellen. En het is heel fijn dat commissaris Katainen ""duurzame financiering"" noemde, maar daarbij gaat het nu bijna alleen maar over transparantie. Cruciale vraag zal uiteindelijk worden: hoe moedigen wij groene en sociaal rechtvaardige investeringen aan? En hoe ontmoedigen wij investeringen die dat niet zijn? Ook The Economist zegt dat de markt dit niet alleen kan. Daarom hebben we uw hulp heel hard nodig, niet morgen, maar vandaag.","Dank u, mevrouw de voorzitter.

Paolo Gentiloni,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I had a sense of pride in this debate. And I think that we the Parliament, the Commission, the European institutions, we should be proud of what we were able to decide in the circumstances of the pandemic crisis. Is this plan for the previous crisis and not so useful for the situation we are in? I think this would be a big mistake that we should avoid. We are in a moment of low growth. We hear the decision-making persons speaking about the risk of stagflation or recession. We can avoid these risks. But these plans – reforms and investments, not digging holes and filling holes, but reforms and investments coordinated with common goals – are essential if we want to address the situation we are in now. I am not saying that the Commission will not consider targeted and limited amendments to the plans. I am saying that it would be a mistake, in my view – and I think we agreed on this with the rapporteur – to restart the design of these plans. Now we have to implement, implement, implement with the necessary amendments, but implementing what we decided in the last one year and a half, and of course, respecting milestones. Milestones should be respected. I think that the Parliament control will help the Commission also to make the milestone respected in the plans where they are very challenging. And the Polish plan is one of them with very challenging milestones. They should be respected before any payment. Last point, of course there is a discussion on how can we strengthen what we have on the table. This discussion is perfectly legitimate. We have now REPowerEU, which is part of the possibility to strengthen our tools. But honestly, the discussion on further tools, which I perfectly understand, is a discussion that will be stronger if we will be able to implement what we have. So let us work together to make RRF function well, because this will be the basis also to strengthen it in further initiatives.","Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I had a sense of pride in this debate.

Artur Zasada ,PPE," I would like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on a document which makes a significant contribution to the debate on the shape of the common agricultural policy.

A key issue in terms of job creation is the promotion among women of electronic forms of entrepreneurship such as e-commerce, which make it possible to be economically active even in inaccessible areas. We should also make better use of opportunities aimed at developing community life in rural areas by drafting and implementing programmes supporting training systems for women’s organisations. Something else which is of key significance in terms of equal opportunities is support for the putting in place of appropriate childcare infrastructure in rural areas, since properly functioning childcare makes it easier for women to return to work more quickly and makes them more competitive in the labour market.

To conclude, water really stands at the heart of human development, but also peace and stability. Without adequate safe and affordable water and sanitation, billions of people, including particularly women, young people and children, around the globe are unable to lead healthy lives and lack the ability to build secure livelihoods.

Emma McClarkin ,ECR,"Mr President, the report on a common system for taxing financial transactions states that such a tax can have a positive impact on the long-term growth of the EU. However, I believe it will do exactly the opposite. As I have said before, surely my colleagues from Sweden can understand and share my position towards an EU-wide FTT. The report acknowledges that there is a lack of international agreement but states that the EU should go ahead anyway. However, if the EU does go it alone, we may find that, as in Sweden in the 1980s, the vast majority of our traders in bonds, equities and derivatives will relocate outside of the EU. This is unlikely to promote the growth that we all desire. The City of London plays host to a comparatively large financial services sector which is already subject to stamp duty at national level, therefore contributing to the prosperity of the EU as a whole. It would be disproportionate to request the City of London to pay in addition an EU-wide FTT, putting it at a comparative disadvantage internationally. I find this tax to be unfair and I have voted against the report.","Mr President, the report on a common system for taxing financial transactions states that such a tax can have a positive impact on the long-term growth of the EU.

Nicolas Bay,ID,"au nom du groupe ID. – Monsieur le Président, chers collègues, trois milliards d’euros de plus pour la Turquie, c’est la décision prise par le Conseil que, Madame von der Leyen, vous étiez tout heureuse d’annoncer. Vous espérez sans doute qu’Erdoğan se montrera reconnaissant en vous réservant un siège lors de votre prochaine rencontre. Cette nouvelle enveloppe prolonge l’accord entre l’Union européenne et la Turquie sur les migrants. Alors qu’Ankara est, en contrepartie de cet argent, supposée contrôler les flux migratoires, elle se retrouve dans les faits dotée d’un nouveau moyen de pression. Notre Parlement est prompt à dénoncer l’instrumentalisation des migrants par le Maroc et la Biélorussie. Il serait bon qu’il se décide enfin à sanctionner les agissements turcs. Le Conseil salue par ailleurs, je cite, la «désescalade en Méditerranée orientale». Sans doute est-ce là une des motivations pour l’octroi de nouveaux milliards. Lorsque Erdoğan montre les crocs, l’Union européenne n’ose pas répondre. Lorsqu’il se calme très temporairement, sans toutefois reconnaître ses torts, Bruxelles s’empresse de le féliciter en espérant ainsi l’amadouer. Mais ni l’argent, ni les gestes d’apaisement ne l’empêchent de nous cracher au visage. La Turquie a immédiatement réagi, estimant que trois milliards ne sont pas assez. Erdoğan veut plus, toujours plus. Il s’attaque également une nouvelle fois à la souveraineté de Chypre, dont les Turcs occupent près de la moitié du territoire depuis maintenant 50 ans. La Turquie, qui continue à coloniser l’île, exige la création de deux États. Refusant le rapport de force face à ce pays qui nous menace ouvertement, nous envoie des milliers de migrants et viole les espaces aériens et maritimes des pays européens, les institutions européennes ne sont pas à la hauteur des enjeux. Elles persistent à croire que l’on peut s’entendre avec Erdoğan en lui faisant chaque fois plus de concessions. Que lui cédera Bruxelles cette fois-ci? La libéralisation des visas ou, évidemment, une modernisation de l’Union douanière. Il est temps de dire stop et de mettre enfin un terme de manière formelle et irréversible au processus d’adhésion de la Turquie à l’Union européenne. Enfin, puisque le sujet fut abordé par le Conseil, je ne peux m’empêcher d’évoquer le scandaleux procès intenté à la Hongrie s’agissant de son projet de loi contre la pédophilie. Les allégations de discrimination et d’homophobie relèvent de la pure désinformation, ce que l’on peut constater en prenant la peine de se pencher deux minutes sur le contenu réel de ce texte. La Hongrie veut protéger ses enfants contre les délires de l’idéologie du genre et de la transidentité. L’hystérie autour de cette affaire montre que Budapest a bien raison de vouloir limiter la propagande d’un communautarisme LGBT toujours plus agressif et revendicatif.","au nom du groupe ID. – Monsieur le Président, chers collègues, trois milliards d’euros de plus pour la Turquie, c’est la décision prise par le Conseil que, Madame von der Leyen, vous étiez tout heureuse d’annoncer.

Herzlichen Dank an die Berichterstatter für den EU-Haushaltsentwurf 2022 und besonderen Dank an meine wunderbaren Kollegen von S&D, Renew und Left. Wir haben zusammen diesen Haushalt nicht nur grüner, sondern auch zukunftsorientierter gemacht. Der EU-Haushalt 2022 ist der zweite Haushalt des mehrjährigen Finanzrahmens, für den klar gilt: Bis spätestens 2030 wollen wir allermindestens die Pariser Klimaziele umsetzen. Da brauchen wir mehr Tempo, mehr Ehrgeiz und klare Entscheidungen, wie wir Steuergelder an den richtigen Stellen investieren, weil wir wissen: Da, wo Geld hinfließt, da wird wirklich Politik gemacht. Wir Grüne haben für den EU-Haushalt 2022 drei Prioritäten, das sind Klima, Biodiversität und Forschung und Entwicklung. Denn klar ist: Wir brauchen starke Forschung und Innovation für grüne Technologie, für die Dekarbonisierung der Wirtschaft und für eine ökologisch-soziale Transformation für einen starken Wirtschaftsstandort Europa. Wir haben jetzt einen EU-Haushalt 2022 auf den Weg gebracht mit großen Aufstockungen für wichtige Programme, mit insgesamt mehr als 1,64 Milliarden Euro zusätzlich zum Haushaltsentwurf. Das heißt konkret: Über 450 Millionen Euro entfallen auf Klima- und Biodiversitätsprogramme – mein persönliches Highlight ist dabei das Plus von 171 Millionen Euro für LIFE –, und es entfallen jetzt mehr als 430 Millionen Euro auf Forschung und Entwicklung. Wir haben außerdem 760 Millionen Euro für weitere Prioritäten wie humanitäre Hilfe, EU4Health, Rechte und Werte und Erasmus+, und das ist auch eine wunderbare Sache.

Miguel Arias Cañete,N/A,"Madam President, all the House has listened to the passionate speech of the President of the Marshall Islands calling on us for ambition and action.  The best answer we can give is, first of all, to confirm that we will not renegotiate the Paris Agreement and that we will make all the efforts needed to provide the political momentum behind the Paris implementation. The implementation of the Paris Agreement domestically requires that this House gives full support in moving ahead on making the European Union’s commitment a reality.  The European Union is showing the world the way with our cutting-edge climate policy and there is no stronger statement we can make than swift progress on the ETS, the effort-sharing regulation, the land-use legislation as well as on the Clean Energy for all European Package. When we ratified the Paris Agreement in record time this House showed its commitment to climate action and we need to provide the same spirit now, more than ever. Internationally we will have to implement the Paris Agreement by working closely with all our allies with ambition and determination. And as Ms Van Brempt and some others clearly stated, we have to keep working with the United States, which is much more than the Federal Government. In the United States the decision to withdraw also strengthened the resolve of those who care for the future of the planet and who understand the economic opportunities of a low-carbon transition. Hundreds of United States mayors, governors, state attorneys-general, CEOs and others pledged to the United Nations to achieve and eventually exceed America’s commitment to the Paris Agreement in a declaration entitled ‘We Are Still In’ and they will submit a Societal Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations, aggregating action by different stakeholders and building upon the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy.  The states of California, Washington and New York founded the United States Climate Alliance, now joined by nine other states. So it is clear that we will continue to have great partners within the United States even if the Federal Government decides to stay on the side of the road. We will also step up our climate diplomacy. Climate action was a key topic of the European Union-China Summit on 2 June and our cooperation on the ground with China is stepping up a gear. In September the European Union will host a major ministerial gathering with ministers here from China and Minister McKenna from Canada to advance in the implementation of Paris and accelerate their transition. Finally, my last remark to his House is that the world’s reaction to President Trump’s action proved that the European Union is on the right side of history. Our task ahead is clear. Let’s keep our resolve.","Madam President, all the House has listened to the passionate speech of the President of the Marshall Islands calling on us for ambition and action.

José Manuel Fernandes ,PPE," On 15 June 2011 – the expiry date of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, which had been in force for four years – a new year-long protocol was signed, with a view to drafting a new agreement in that period that respected the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. Pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in order for the Council to be able to conclude a new protocol, Parliament needs to approve this draft protocol agreed between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, setting out the fishing opportunities for EU fishing fleets in Guinea-Bissau’s waters and the financial contribution to be paid by the Union. Given that this protocol renews the terms of the previous protocol, adding nothing more than ‘additional clauses concerning the suspension and revision of the financial compensation and the suspension of its implementation in case of breach of the essential and fundamental elements of human rights and democratic principles as provided for in Art. 9 of the Cotonou Agreement’, I voted for this recommendation to adopt the new protocol.","On 15 June 2011 – the expiry date of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, which had been in force for four years – a new year-long protocol was signed, with a view to drafting a new agreement in that period that respected the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement.

Manfred Weber,PPE,"Mr President, a few days ago, the Mail on Sunday published an opinion poll: 50% of British people are in favour of a new referendum. (Heckling) The British people realise now that Brexit means losing many things but not gaining anything. Let me mention just one example, which was an interesting one: the debate in recent days in Britain about the decision of the Commission that British cities can no longer be European Capitals of Culture. (Heckling) A very easy message that you can understand, the British will lose a lot. And on the other hand, the European Member States understand that sticking together makes all of us much stronger. (Applause) I want to use Ireland as an example of this. Whereas the United Kingdom could easily set the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, the recent negotiations have clearly demonstrated that Ireland is today much stronger because it belongs to the European Union. (Heckling and applause) We are all Irish: that is the main message, and we Europeans have secured Irish interests in the negotiations in the last few weeks. I want to underline two concrete points: one is that in this first phase, the idea was to create trust between Great Britain and the European Union. I have to say that the recent statement by David Davis about what this outcome now means practically was not helpful in securing this trust-building approach, so we ask the British Prime Minister to clarify by Thursday that the outcome of the first phase is binding on both sides, and is a basis for future talks in the second phase. For the second phase we have a key role to play. We finally decide about the withdrawal treaty and for my group, one thing is clear: we can only accept a kind of transitional period if we have a sufficient outcome from the second phase. Without a withdrawal treaty there will be no transitional period – that must be clear for next year, 2018. Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, ich möchte noch auf ein zweites Thema eingehen, weil wir uns heute in der Dezembersitzung befinden. Wenn wir die Menschen von Europa überzeugen wollen, müssen wir über unsere Erfolge reden, wie es auch Frans Timmermans heute gemacht hat. Im Jahr 2017, in diesem abgelaufenen Jahr, haben wird insgesamt 74 Legislativakte auf den Weg gebracht. Wir sind beim Pariser Klimaabkommen, beim wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung für Europa, bei CETA vorangekommen, und bei anderen internationalen Handelsabkommen haben wir gezeigt, dass wir Brücken bauen und nicht Brücken abreißen wollen. Bei der Verteidigung sind historische Schritte gemacht worden. Bei der Zusammenarbeit im Verteidigungsbereich und auch bei der Sozialunion gibt es Fortschritte zu vermelden.  Wir liefern in der Sache. Das ist die wichtigste Botschaft an die Bürger. Wenn wir sie von Europa überzeugen wollen, brauchen wir keine Theoriedebatten – wir brauchen Lösungen in der Sache. Da sind wir in den letzten Monaten sehr stark vorangekommen. Für 2018 möchte ich deutlich machen, dass ein Hauptthema die Frage der Grenzsicherung ist. Wir müssen den Bürgern in Europa deutlich machen, dass es uns gelingt, unseren eigenen Kontinent zu sichern, vor allem, wenn es um die illegale Migration geht.  Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Der European Way of Life ist eines der Themen, das meine Fraktion stark umtreibt. Es gilt ihn zu definieren und zu beschützen, und das gerade in unsicheren Zeiten. Lassen Sie mich deswegen heute als dritten Gedanken einen sehr grundsätzlichen Gedanken einbringen, nämlich dass ich gerade jetzt in der Weihnachtszeit darauf verweisen will, dass unser Kontinent christliche Wurzeln hat. 75 % aller EU- Bürger sind Christen. Meine Fraktion ist stolz auf dieses christliche Erbe, das Europa in unseren Kirchen, aber auch in unseren Traditionen und im täglichen Leben lebt.  Wenn wir heute auf die Grundstruktur unseres Kontinents blicken, auf die Ideen der Solidarität, auf die Ideen der Subsidiarität, auf die Ideen der Toleranz im Umgang miteinander, dann sind viele dieser Grundwerte nicht denkbar ohne die christlich-jüdischen Wurzeln unseres Kontinents. Diese Fundamente sollten wir uns bewusst machen. Auch Nicht- Christen, auch Menschen, die den Glauben ablehnen, werden in den nächsten Tagen froh sein, dass Europa stillsteht, dass wir auf diesem Kontinent einmal zur Ruhe kommen. Das Erbe, dass Weihnachten in ganz Europa praktiziert wird, führt dazu, dass unser Leben und auch unser Jahresablauf Struktur hat.  Deswegen möchte ich zum Schluss zum Ausdruck bringen, dass diese Werte für uns als Fraktion wichtig sind, dass uns die Grundlage dieses Kontinents immer wieder bewusst sein sollte und dass wir auch stolz darauf sein dürfen.

Nicolaus Fest,ID," – Herr Präsident, Frau Kommissarin! Natürlich müssen Künstler unterstützt werden, aber eben nicht auf Kosten des Steuerzahlers. Das Creative-Europe-Programm war schon in der letzten Legislaturperiode ein Korruptions- und Propagandafonds für linke Minderleister. Jetzt ist es eben ein um 63 % erhöhter Korruptions- und Propagandafonds für Minderleister, und eben alles auf Kosten der Steuerzahler. Denn was wird beispielsweise aus dem Creative-Europe-Programm finanziert? Es werden Zirkusse finanziert, darunter auch äthiopische Zirkusse, und da muss man Frau Gabriel mal fragen: Haben Sie mal auf die Landkarte geguckt? Äthiopien gehört nicht zu Europa.  Gleichzeitig werden auch noch die Gender Books finanziert – darunter ein sehr schönes, das ich mir besorgt habe, über ein schwules Kängurupärchen, das über eine lesbische Leihmutter ein Kind adoptiert. Ich bin auch noch im INGE-Ausschuss gegen Desinformation. Frau Gabriel, ist das eigentlich Desinformation, oder glauben Sie, dass es in der Natur schwule Kängurupärchen und lesbische Leihmütter gibt?  Dann werden beispielsweise auch noch Filme finanziert, die man sich auf YouTube angucken kann: Kissenschlachten von Kindern, die darüber nachdenken sollen, ob sie gleichzeitig maskulin und feminin sind, und Tanzstunden für Migranten und Flüchtlinge, die so aussehen, dass sich die Leute auf das Kommando „Fisch“ hin um den Hals fallen und abbusserln. Also wenn das die europäische Kultur ist, dann ist Europa wirklich am Ende.  Und dieser dümmliche Fonds, der jetzt leider auch noch erhöht wurde, wird ja vielleicht einigen unbekannten Künstlern ein bisschen als Sozialpolitik weiterhelfen, aber mit Kreativität und mit der Forderung von wirklicher Kultur hat das hier alles gar nichts zu tun.","– Herr Präsident, Frau Kommissarin!

Annika Bruna,ID,"au nom du groupe ID. – Monsieur le Président, ce rapport sur la réglementation de la prostitution dans l’Union européenne souhaite harmoniser les différentes législations des États membres sur le modèle dit «nordique» ou «abolitionniste», qui consiste à dépénaliser les prostituées et à criminaliser les clients.

Georgios Papanikolaou ,PPE," Mr President, I should like to take my turn in congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, on her excellent report and on all her efforts to date.

Viktor Uspaskich ,ALDE," Ladies and gentlemen, the Baltic Sea plays a very important role in Lithuanian society. Most of our reserves lie on the shore of the Baltic Sea. For us Lithuanians, the Baltic Sea is really valuable from a logistical point of view – in particular, due to Klaipėda sea port – and also from a natural and cultural point of view. Unfortunately, as stated in this report, the Baltic Sea is suffering greatly from man-made dangers, for example, air pollution, climate change, stock depletion and acidification. The Member States which are acting individually cannot be left on their own to solve the environmental problems that have come about in the Baltic Sea region. A joint action programme like BONUS is particularly necessary at present. Scientific research is the answer to the ecological, social and economic challenges experienced. The BONUS programme will create a positive common agenda for Lithuania and our Baltic neighbours – this close cooperation could also include political and economic issues. Although the attention of the BONUS programme is largely focused on environmental research, we should not forget the other benefit that this programme may provide. The BONUS programme may be of significant social and economic benefit and contribute to the achievement of the goals set out in the Lisbon Strategy by investing in knowledge related to growth and employment. That would improve the situation in various sectors – fishing, tourism, maritime transportation and aquaculture.","Ladies and gentlemen, the Baltic Sea plays a very important role in Lithuanian society.

It is hard to imagine a more competitive EU being built without the participation of countries such as the United Kingdom, Sweden or Poland, so I welcome the news that the Euro Plus Pact has been adopted.

Kristalina Georgieva,N/A,"Madam President, honourable Members, President Caldeira, members of the Court, on behalf of the Commission I would like to express our deepest gratitude to the Court for the work you do. It helps us to use our taxpayers’ money better. I fully agree with the call by President Caldeira for a new approach, and it is what we have embraced in the Commission with our strategy on a results-focused budget. We have made progress on financial management, and the Court has recognised that our accounts are in order by signing them for an eighth year in a row. They are modern, they are up to standard, and we thank the Court for the work it has done that helped us to stabilise the error rate and, indeed, to reduce it slightly. That is a trend that we must pursue in the future. However, we also recognise there is more work to be done, and I would like to focus my response on the four points that President Caldeira made. Firstly, we have work to do on bringing the error rate down further by improving the quality of first-level checks, by continuing our simplification efforts – simpler rules mean fewer errors – and by further deepening work on the cost-effectiveness of checks. The Court tells us that we have a higher level in respect of schemes that reimburse costs, and a lower level in respect of entitlement programmes. We have to take this into account. Secondly, we fully agree with the Court about the importance of focusing on performance. We are in a very difficult time for the European Union, and every single euro matters. The Union has to work better for our people, and this is at the heart of the work we are doing on a results-focused budget. We will also continue combining performance and compliance. We believe that work we have started already on preventive and corrective action in relation to errors is bringing positive results: EUR 3.5 billion has been returned to the budget thanks to corrective action and preventive action that we have taken. We believe that, if we take into account the calculated residual error rate, we would be very close to the 2% that we strive to achieve. Thirdly, on financial backlogs. This was a priority issue in the discussion on the 2016 budget, and we are committed to bringing the backlog down to EUR 2 billion by the end of 2016 – to a sustainable level. And of course, work has to concentrate on the new programmes so we do not end up with the same problem three years down the road. Last but definitely not least: transparency is our taxpayers’ best friend, and we are committed to continuing to improve it. We are grateful to Parliament for recognising that we have made progress over this last year in terms of the transparency of our work, and we absolutely commit here to continuing that effort in the future. In conclusion, President Caldeira said we must invest money better.

Keith Taylor,Greens/EFA,"Mr President, colleagues, I speak to you today as the rapporteur on last year’s report on Regulation (EU) 261/2004 and Regulation (EU) 1008/2008 and also as the Green shadow for Mr Bach’s report today. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very constructive approach, and I am very pleased to say that we have been able to change the emphasis in the Commission proposal from one which was largely pro-industry – pro-airline – to one which is much more pro-passenger, and that is the version we will vote on today. Although my Group’s view that compensation should be paid after one hour was not carried, a compromise of three hours was, and that also mirrors the European Court of Justice’s position of three hours as the trigger. So this is considerably better than the starting point of the Commission, which was five hours. We are also able to support the narrowing of the extraordinary circumstances to stop airlines hiding behind this excuse to avoid paying compensation to travellers to whom it is due. I am pleased to see the recommendations about better communication with passengers, and I also hope that implementation can be improved. In that regard, I think that our suggestion of independent mediation bodies will prove very useful.  Also, the environmental impact and energy efficiency of passengers’ travel will be provided on the website and on the tickets for the journey. We cannot expect people to be more responsible about carbon emissions if they do not know what the effect of their activities will be.  All in all I am very pleased to be able to support this report, and I would like to thank Mr Bach once more for his constructive approach.","Mr President, colleagues, I speak to you today as the rapporteur on last year’s report on Regulation 261/2004 and Regulation 1008/2008 and also as the Green shadow for Mr Bach’s report today.

Vilija Blinkevičiūtė ,S&D," Mr President, the issue of human rights must be addressed at European level and the Member States themselves must also take responsibility for guaranteeing the fundamental rights of their citizens. At European level, for instance, it is very important to establish a European Union strategy on the rights of the child, because not all Member States are capable of guaranteeing the protection of children’s rights at national level. It is therefore necessary to develop practical measures to combat child abuse, sexual exploitation and child pornography. Disabled people, who still suffer from discrimination in their social, professional and cultural lives, are another priority. We must therefore establish a concrete system of EU legislation on the rights of disabled people and develop an EU strategy on the disabled. I would like to stress that combating trafficking of human beings, especially women and children, is still a huge problem and one of the worst violations of human rights. It is also very important to combat poverty and social exclusion, particularly as regards elderly people, who have suffered most during the recession.","Mr President, the issue of human rights must be addressed at European level and the Member States themselves must also take responsibility for guaranteeing the fundamental rights of their citizens.

Mohammed Chahim,S&D," – Voorzitter, laat mij heel duidelijk zijn: we moeten van het Russisch gas af. Het is niet alleen onwenselijk, maar zelfs immoreel om in deze tijd de schatkist van Poetin te blijven spekken. En zij die denken dat de prijzen nu pas de hoogte in zijn geschoten door sancties, vergis je niet: de prijzen waren al hoog. Poetin sjoemelt al langer met de gasprijzen. We moeten zo snel mogelijk af van dergelijke manipulatieve praktijken. Hoe gaan we dat doen? We hebben vandaag een prachtig plan gezien, REPowerEU, een realistisch plan om dit jaar nog het gas uit Rusland met twee derde te verminderen. En laat ons niet vergeten: één van de beste oplossingen die we hebben, bestaat al, die heet de Europese Green Deal, ons plan voor de middellange termijn. Daarnaast zijn er zeker nog grote winsten te boeken op het vlak van energiebesparing. Energie die je niet verbruikt, hoef je niet te importeren. De vraag naar gas kan bijvoorbeeld met ongeveer tien miljard kubieke meter worden verminderd door de thermostaat met één graad te verlagen. Laat energie-efficiëntie en energiebesparing daden van verzet worden tegen Russische agressie. Het is nu tijd om te handelen.

Las reservas de agua embalsada en las cuencas hidrográficas de España y Portugal afrontan su peor dato en años y no hay previsiones de que llueva en las próximas semanas. Entre el 1 de octubre y el 1 de febrero, las lluvias en España fueron un 36 % menores de la medida de 1981-2010. Los expertos en cambio climático advierten de que el calentamiento implicará una mayor evapotranspiración en la región mediterránea y que las reservas de agua disponible serán menores, repitiéndose con más frecuencia situaciones como la actual. Además, el riesgo de incendios será mayor y las cosechas sufrirán mayores impactos.  Los socialistas en el Parlamento defendemos la necesidad de apoyo de la UE, de cooperación entre Estados miembros, de la gestión eficaz y racional de los recursos hídricos, del Convenio de Albufera y de una Estrategia europea sobre desertificación. Asimismo, trabajamos para que las poblaciones más vulnerables y pobres no se vean más afectadas y nos posicionamos en contra del inviable objetivo de absorciones asignado a España en la nueva propuesta de Reglamento UTCUTS, que no tiene en cuenta los impactos del cambio climático.","por escrito. – La Península ibérica vive una de las peores sequías invernales de las últimas décadas.

Harald Vilimsky,ID," – Herr Präsident, meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren! Ich freue mich ja, solange diese Debattenserie noch unter dem Titel „This is Europe“ laufen kann. Denn wenn die illegale Migration weitergeht, wie sie seit 2015 hier in Richtung Europa der Fall ist, wird diese Debattenserie bald „This is Arabia“ oder „This is Africa“ heißen und nicht mehr „This is Europe“. Es sind über 7 Millionen Menschen seit dem Jahr 2015, dem Arabischen Frühling, hier nach Europa gekommen. Die überwiegende Mehrheit dieser Menschen hat nicht nach einer ausführlichen Prüfung den Status eines Flüchtlings nach der Genfer Konvention noch den Status eines subsidiär oder humanitär Schutzberechtigten. Die Menschen sind hierhergekommen als Hoffnungssuchende und haben alle Regeln missachtet. Es ist so, dass etwa von denen, die illegal hier in Europa aufhältig sind, um die 80 % aufgefordert werden, in ihre Heimat zurückzukehren, es aber nicht tun. Mit diesen Migrationsströmen hat sich auch eine kulturelle Transformation in den großen europäischen Metropolen ergeben. Schauen Sie nach Paris, schauen Sie nach München, auch Brüssel oder meine Heimatstadt Wien. Und nicht nur eine kulturelle Transformation, auch – und das kann man nicht verschweigen – massive Sicherheitsprobleme. Erwähnen wir hier auch noch einmal: Bataclan-Theater, Brüsseler Flughafen, bis zu dem, was sich letzte Woche hier in Frankreich mit dem Messerattentat ereignet hat. Meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren, ich komme zum Schluss: Europa kann nur eine Zukunft haben, wenn wir weiter nicht im Visier illegaler Migration stehen und den Menschen auch ehrlich sagen, dass wir bereit sind, ihnen in ihren Regionen zu helfen, aber sie nicht alle nach Europa hereinlassen.","– Herr Präsident, meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren!

Julie Ward,S&D," – Mr President, the humanitarian, political and economic crisis in Venezuela needs an urgent response. The recent report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the situation is very worrying, because it paints a bleak picture of the human rights situation in the country. The only way out of the deadlock in which Venezuelan society finds itself is through a negotiated solution that includes all sections of society. It is important that women, young people and minorities are included in the process, as they hold the keys to building an inclusive peace.  I trust Venezuelans will find a peaceful solution through the negotiation process currently facilitated by Norway. As Europeans, it is important that we support these talks and oppose any calls for a military intervention. War is not the solution. The future of Venezuela should not be built on the use of violence, and the talks seem to be constructive. I call on all parties to continue working positively in order to reach the objective of holding free and fair elections with international observers. I want to state my full support for the pre-conditions laid out by the EU-led international contact group, including the release of political prisoners.

Aldo Patriciello ,PPE," The current financial crisis has brought to light something that Parliament criticised many years ago: the lack of adequate financial regulation and the weakness of the market supervisory mechanisms. Parliament warned that, if a crisis in the system were to be avoided, it was essential to pursue three objectives: liberalisation of the markets, strengthening of control mechanisms and harmonisation of taxation on savings. To close the regulatory gaps and alleviate and correct the weaknesses in the supervisory system, the Commission recommends the establishment of a network of national supervisors and the introduction of a single rulebook to protect depositors, investors and consumers in the European Union. The ‘Europe’ solution would mean giving the colleges of supervisors the right to dictate rules, compliance with which would be mandatory, when national supervisory authorities cannot reach an agreement. Parliament’s report also proposes the creation of a European Fund financed by contributions from the financial institutions to protect depositors and rescue institutions in difficulty where their bankruptcy could ruin the entire system. The ultimate aim of this report is to establish a mechanism to resolve future crises that will make it less likely that European taxpayers will find themselves having to deal with the repercussions of a breakdown in the financial system.","The current financial crisis has brought to light something that Parliament criticised many years ago: the lack of adequate financial regulation and the weakness of the market supervisory mechanisms.

Harlem Désir ,S&D," The 2020 strategy is supposed to replace the Lisbon Strategy. It is, above all, in danger of prolonging the shortcomings, of ending in the same lack of results and of causing the same disappointment. It is neither a true recovery strategy nor a new perspective for the economic, social, budgetary and fiscal policies of the Union. The myriad good intentions are matched only by the absence of new instruments with which to implement them. Europe needs a different ambition; the citizens expect more convincing responses. Since the start of the crisis, the unemployment rate has increased by seven million. The banks are speculating again, hedge funds have not been regulated, the citizens are being asked to tighten their belts, drastic cuts are being made in public services and social protection is being cut back. The Greek crisis serves to reveal our lack of solidarity. That is why Europe must debate a different view of its future, one that is based on true economic coordination, a recovery characterised by solidarity, a green growth strategy, an energy community, a cohesion budget, own resources, investment in education, research, fiscal and social harmonisation, the fight against tax havens and the taxation of international financial transactions.","The 2020 strategy is supposed to replace the Lisbon Strategy.

Antonyia Parvanova,ALDE,"Madam President, one year after the adoption of the directive on combating and preventing trafficking in human beings, Member States still need to take concrete action to put an end to trafficking and effectively protect the victims of such crimes. We hope that the directive, including its provisions concerning criminal offences, will be implemented in a timely, consistent and effective manner and will, together with the EU strategy, lead to improved cooperation cross the Union. The further legal framework would enable Member States’ actions to have a greater impact not only in terms of law enforcement but also for the protection and assistance provided to victims. It is therefore crucial that the European anti-trafficking coordinator is provided with appropriate tools and means of cooperation, in order to coordinate efforts at national and EU level. Existing data show that women and girls represent the majority of trafficked people, and we should take into account the root causes of such phenomena, particularly when we speak about gender-based discrimination and violence against women. In this respect, transposing and implementing this directive with an open gender perspective is crucially needed. Further efforts in terms of ensuring the establishment of national rapporteurs responsible for gathering gender-separated national statistics and data would be welcome. In terms of prevention and information, gender-sensitive awareness campaigns still remain to be developed. Finally, as rapporteur for the European Parliament on the Victims’ Rights Package, I would like to stress the need to draw up a solid and ambitious legislative framework establishing minimum standards for victims of crimes and facilitating the recognition of protection measures – civil or criminal –across the EU. I hope the Council will also acknowledge that supporting victims and recognising their rights throughout the Union is essential in order to facilitate the reporting of crimes and effectively combat organised crime networks which abuse thousands of people and deprive them of their fundamental rights, regardless of their nationality and place of residence.","Madam President, one year after the adoption of the directive on combating and preventing trafficking in human beings, Member States still need to take concrete action to put an end to trafficking and effectively protect the victims of such crimes.

Valdemar Tomaševski,ECR,"raštu. – šiandien diskutuojame apie vieną svarbiausių kiekvienam darbuotojui klausimų – apie teisinę apsaugą, kuri kiekvienam darbuotojui turėtų užtikrinti tikrą saugumo jausmą ir sąžiningą darbdavių elgesį su darbuotojais. Be jokios abejonės, darbo vietas ir darbuotojus reikia geriau apsaugoti. Europos darbuotojų teisių sistema turi parodyti valstybėms narėms aukštus darbdavio ir darbuotojo santykių standartus. Jie taip pat turi užkirsti kelią nesąžiningai ir neteisėtai veiklai darbuotojų atžvilgiu.  Ekonominė ir pandeminė krizė atskleidė daug teisinės darbuotojų apsaugos trūkumų. Vyko didžiuliai atleidimai iš darbo. Todėl, siekiant išvengti nedarbo didėjimo, būtina sparčiai kurti naujoviškas darbo vietų išsaugojimo priemones. Pagrindinis tokios strategijos elementas turi būti bendradarbiavimas ir supratimas darbo vietoje, kad darbuotojai galėtų kalbėti apie jiems rūpimus reikalus. Jie privalo turėti teisę laisvai jungtis, įskaitant privačias bendroves, grupes, sąjungas ar darbo tarybas. Tai taps būtina formuojant geresnius santykius darbo vietoje ir pagerins įmonių bei firmų funkcionavimą.  Jau yra Europos Komisijos pateiktų pavyzdžių.

Be jokios abejonės, darbo vietas ir darbuotojus reikia geriau apsaugoti. Europos darbuotojų teisių sistema turi parodyti valstybėms narėms aukštus darbdavio ir darbuotojo santykių standartus. Jie taip pat turi užkirsti kelią nesąžiningai ir neteisėtai veiklai darbuotojų atžvilgiu. Ekonominė ir pandeminė krizė atskleidė daug teisinės darbuotojų apsaugos trūkumų. Vyko didžiuliai atleidimai iš darbo. Todėl, siekiant išvengti nedarbo didėjimo, būtina sparčiai kurti naujoviškas darbo vietų išsaugojimo priemones. Pagrindinis tokios strategijos elementas turi būti bendradarbiavimas ir supratimas darbo vietoje, kad darbuotojai galėtų kalbėti apie jiems rūpimus reikalus. Jie privalo turėti teisę laisvai jungtis, įskaitant privačias bendroves, grupes, sąjungas ar darbo tarybas. Tai taps būtina formuojant geresnius santykius darbo vietoje ir pagerins įmonių bei firmų funkcionavimą. Jau yra Europos Komisijos pateiktų pavyzdžių.

Apprezzo, pertanto, che la Banca europea per gli investimenti (BEI) intenda porre al centro della propria strategia climatica e della propria politica dei prestiti la decarbonizzazione del settore energetico e lo sviluppo di fonti rinnovabili e verdi, in linea con gli obiettivi per lo sviluppo sostenibile delle Nazioni Unite e l'accordo di Parigi. È positivo, parimenti, che tale strategia, con equilibrio ed equità, preveda misure a supporto della riconversione energetica quali l'energy transition package: in un settore strategico come quello dell'energia, infatti, innovazione e sostenibilità non possono prescindere dal mantenimento della sicurezza energetica e dalla tutela della dimensione sociale ad essa connessa. Ritengo, infine, importante l'attenzione riservata dalla BEI alle piccole e medie imprese (PMI) e allo sviluppo di progetti di energia verde su piccola scala e diffusi. Occorre, infatti, rimuovere gli ostacoli che le PMI ancora incontrano nella realizzazione della propria efficienza energetica, per via della natura frammentaria degli investimenti e dell'accesso limitato a strumenti di finanziamento in tale settore.

Iliana Ivanova,N/A,"Mr President, I wish to thank President Hoyer for his responsiveness and openness, and would also thank Commissioner Rehn and all my colleagues for this fruitful discussion. I also wish to thank everyone involved in the process of preparing this report, which I think is balanced and which acknowledges the EIB’s achievements in 2010 and highlights the red-flag points raised during our discussion. Let me point briefly to some additional important elements in the report that have also been raised in our discussion today. Firstly, on financial instruments, I consider the cooperation between the EIB and the Commission in this field to be a good example of joint actions and I underline the positive outcome of existing instruments, such as the Risk Sharing Financing Facility. However, I believe it essential to develop a comprehensive global audit system which will contribute to ensuring the best control management of these instruments in view of their growing complexity. Secondly, on project bonds, I fully share Commissioner Rehn’s position and welcome and support the EU 2020 bonds initiative. I welcome the agreement on the pilot phase of the project, which I believe is crucial in order to assess the effectiveness of the new system and to remedy any problems which may occur, in advance and as soon as possible. Thirdly, on prudential regulatory supervision, I share the view that the EIB should be subject to the same prudential rules as other credit establishments in the Union. This will improve the prudential control on the quality of the Bank’s financial situation and will ensure that its results are accurately measured. Last but not least, the question of climate change was mentioned in the debate. I welcome the EIB’s action on climate change and call on it to refrain from funding certain types of projects which have devastating environmental and social impacts. Furthermore, I call for full alignment of the Bank’s operations with the EU objectives for a swift transition to a low carbon economy. I would like to thank again all my colleagues, and especially the shadow rapporteurs, who worked on this dossier. I hope the House will vote in favour of this report, which will contribute to improving even further the EIB’s activities in support of the EU’s objectives.","Mr President, I wish to thank President Hoyer for his responsiveness and openness, and would also thank Commissioner Rehn and all my colleagues for this fruitful discussion.

José Manuel Fernandes ,PPE," I support greater political integration in the EU and coordinated and strengthened economic governance. Europe needs real solidarity. This solidarity implies that all the Member States are responsible for not harming the others through bad governance or incompetence or concealing data in public accounts. The European Financial Stabilisation Fund to guarantee the stability of the euro is an important first step towards giving the European Union a more robust and sustainable economic and monetary policy framework. It is a pity that this mechanism has taken so long to come. I support having an oversight mechanism for the public accounts and deficits of each Member State to ensure that the reported sanctions will not be applied. I am also of the opinion that there should be a ‘European Monetary Fund’ (EMF) to which euro area countries would contribute in a manner proportionate to the size of their GDP. The sustainability of public finances is essential for the stability and growth of the euro area. However, it is important to restore growth rates and achieve the objective of sustainable economic development and social cohesion, giving priority to dealing with persistent and significant macro-economic imbalances and disparities in competitiveness.","I support greater political integration in the EU and coordinated and strengthened economic governance.

However, it is important to restore growth rates and achieve the objective of sustainable economic development and social cohesion, giving priority to dealing with persistent and significant macro-economic imbalances and disparities in competitiveness.",I support greater political integration in the EU and coordinated and strengthened economic governance. Europe needs real solidarity. This solidarity implies that all the Member States are responsible for not harming the others through bad governance or incompetence or concealing data in public accounts. The European Financial Stabilisation Fund to guarantee the stability of the euro is an important first step towards giving the European Union a more robust and sustainable economic and monetary ,nan
Cindy Franssen,PPE," – Voorzitter, geachte commissaris, beste collega’s, 10 oktober was de dag van de mentale gezondheid en deze problematiek kan niet genoeg onder de aandacht gebracht worden. De kosten van geestelijke gezondheidsproblemen in alle EU—lidstaten bedragen naar schatting meer dan 4 % van het bbp. De kosten van werkgerelateerde depressies worden geraamd op 620 miljard euro per jaar. Ander onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat het aantal kinderen en jongeren met mentale problemen is verdubbeld sinds de pandemie. Daarom moeten we af van het taboe dat nog steeds rust op mentale gezondheid.  Ik ben dan ook tevreden dat Commissievoorzitter Von der Leyen in haar State of the Union een initiatief rond geestelijke gezondheidszorg aankondigde voor 2023.

Maria do Céu Patrão Neves ,PPE," I enthusiastically welcome this report on the implementation of EU legislation aimed at the conservation of biodiversity. It is a product of the importance that all of us recognise that it has in the environmental, economic and social spheres, and in sectors as diverse as agriculture, fisheries and tourism, and it underlines that same importance. Today, I would like to highlight another matter that, although not omitted from the debate, has not received significant attention. I am referring to the intrinsic value of biodiversity, and to the moral duty that we have to protect and defend it. It is up to mankind, which, with the greatest power over biodiversity, has the greatest responsibility to preserve it and transfer this inheritance it has received to future generations to enjoy and care for. Thus, the EU is carrying out its duties by legislating to conserve biodiversity. This matter, undoubtedly, deserves my support.","I enthusiastically welcome this report on the implementation of EU legislation aimed at the conservation of biodiversity.

That is why we in the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are calling for a number of basic criteria for concluding this sort of contract.

Juan Fernando López Aguilar ,S&D," Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I believe that this debate makes it clear that the entire European Parliament is aware that this transformational crisis in North Africa is no longer a test of European foreign policy, but is now a test of the very viability of Europe having an external policy. This is why it is absolutely crucial for the European Union to be able to address the international community with a single and recognisable message. I would like to take advantage of my minute here to add my voice to those who have stressed the importance of the humanitarian dimension in this transformational crisis. This will enable Europe to act to mitigate the effects on the humanitarian front, above all, in terms of displaced people, and of potential asylum seekers and refugees fleeing from the area of conflict to the nearest border, which is the border with the European Union. This is why I want to stress the urgent need for the European Union to complete its still-outstanding asylum package; to review Directive 2001/55/EC on measures to protect displaced people in humanitarian emergencies and cope with the unforeseen mass influx of migrants; to be able to prioritise the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union and the European Asylum Support Office, which are the tools at its disposal; and, above all, to fill the human rights clause of its foreign policy with true meaning, making it not just a verbose clause, but a condition for the very existence of the European Union’s foreign policy.","Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I believe that this debate makes it clear that the entire European Parliament is aware that this transformational crisis in North Africa is no longer a test of European foreign policy, but is now a test of the very viability of Europe having an external policy.

György Schöpflin ,PPE,"Mr President, the decision of the European Council to endorse Serbia’s candidacy has a two-fold significance. With respect to Serbia, it marks the definitive end to the aftermath of the Wars of the Yugoslav Succession, and the lingering assumption widely held at the time that the Serbs were somehow the hereditary villains of the Balkans. With the acceptance of Serbia’s candidacy, that particular canard has been laid to rest. Serbia can now be regarded as having returned to the European family and this has its long-term significance. After all, stability in south-eastern Europe is inconceivable without Serbia – and stability here has to extend to all policy areas, notably crime. Without Serbia’s full commitment in the fight against organised crime, the Balkans would continue to constitute an easy prey for transnational mafias. But the step has a second, possibly greater significance. It makes it clear that EU enlargement, though moving forward only slowly, has not stalled. This obviously has implications for the rest of south-eastern Europe. What is equally noteworthy is that, despite the economic crisis, the EU continues its commitment to enhancing the stability of its neighbourhood, relying on soft power to achieve this. The encouragement of the countries of the Eastern Partnership and the planned elaboration of a road map are evidently steps in the direction of ensuring that objective. All these strategies and policy objectives, however, depend on overcoming the long drawn-out economic crisis, the central concern of the summit. Here, the decisions point in the right direction and it is absolutely crucial that fiscal discipline goes hand in hand with the recognition of the importance of economic growth. In the absence of this, the EU will find itself much less attractive and with much reduced soft power.","Mr President, the decision of the European Council to endorse Serbia’s candidacy has a two-fold significance.

Jeroen Lenaers,PPE,"on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, organised crime is a major threat to the internal security of the European Union and to the safety of our citizens, and it requires a common European response. More than 70% of criminal networks are active in more than three European countries and they are becoming increasingly more violent. According to Europol, organised crime within the EU has never posed such a major threat to citizens and our societies as it does today. We need to disrupt the business models of criminal networks and ensure that crime never pays: follow the money in order to freeze and confiscate assets and target criminal leadership. For the EPP, the security of European citizens and the fight against organised crime is an absolute priority. Europe needs to show that we can deliver in real terms, and this is why last year we proposed 50 concrete measures to tackle crime and we will continue to put this high on Europe’s agenda. And we are happy to find in the Swedish Presidency a like—minded and a constructive partner in our mission to keep Europe safe. And we look forward to cooperate on our shared priorities: strengthening the role of agencies like Europol and Eurojust; better coordination of criminal investigations and prosecutions; implementation of the interoperability framework; further improving existing crucial legislation like the Prüm Framework; advanced passenger information; making e—evidence work in practice. We have to make use of all available instruments in order to fight crime, and we cannot expect law enforcement authorities to do this alone. Local authorities, tax authorities, labour inspectorates, can all play a major role in addressing certain challenges, but they face huge obstacles in cross—border cooperation. We have worked very hard to remove those cross—border obstacles for police and judicial cooperation. We need to do the same for the administrative approach to organised crime by denying criminals the use of the legal administrative infrastructure. More intense monitoring, better screening and proper cross—border exchange of administrative information to complement police cooperation and strengthen the law enforcement system should also be a European priority. Borders often still create obstacles for authorities, while criminals use them to their advantage. This needs to end right now.","on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, organised crime is a major threat to the internal security of the European Union and to the safety of our citizens, and it requires a common European response. More than 70% of criminal networks are active in more than three European countries and they are becoming increasingly more violent. According to Europol, organised crime within the EU has never posed such a major threat to citizens and our societies as it does today. We need to disrupt the business models of criminal networks and ensure that crime never pays: follow the money in order to freeze and confiscate assets and target criminal leadership. For the EPP, the security of European citizens and the fight against organised crime is an absolute priority. Europe needs to show that we can deliver in real terms, and this is why last year we proposed 50 concrete measures to tackle crime and we will continue to put this high on Europe’s agenda. And we are happy to find in the Swedish Presidency a like—minded and a constructive partner in our mission to keep Europe safe. And we look forward to cooperate on our shared priorities: strengthening the role of agencies like Europol and Eurojust; better coordination of criminal investigations and prosecutions; implementation of the interoperability framework; further improving existing crucial legislation like the Prüm Framework; advanced passenger information; making e—evidence work in practice. We have to make use of all available instruments in order to fight crime, and we cannot expect law enforcement authorities to do this alone. Local authorities, tax authorities, labour inspectorates, can all play a major role in addressing certain challenges, but they face huge obstacles in cross—border cooperation.

Why is the EU’s own common fisheries policy allowing a super trawler, 14 times the size of the average British vessel, to fish in an area of the English Channel that is thought to be a breeding area for seabass, a species the EU has banned British fishers from catching due to their scarcity? This vessel has already destroyed fishes off West Africa, been banned from Australian waters and caused controversy in Chile. This supertrawler is known to have horrific bycatch rates which endanger species such as bluefin tuna, John Dory and common dolphins in that area.

In the light of the rising number of cases, European countries are reintroducing restrictions. Today, the call for further precautionary measures is fully justified. Vaccines have not replaced the need for other precautions. Even countries where the vaccination rate is very high, like in my country Malta, will probably need a further tightening of the sanitary rules in the coming weeks. It will be possible to avoid new lockdowns but only if a combination of conditions is met, notably: faster vaccination, compulsory use of masks indoors and the widest possible application of telework. Meanwhile, at EU level, coordination of national measures remains essential to ensure that free movement within the EU is maintained. This will be done by adjusting the validity of the EU digital certificate to preserve its efficiency. The European Commission is rightly aiming to harmonise the validity of the COVID-19 vaccination certificate to include booster shots. These and similar measures have proven effective in past months. Their reinforcement will be essential in the near future. Understandably, there is a widespread ‘pandemic fatigue’.

The objectives are clear: strengthening free competition, and speeding up the process of liberalisation and privatisation of various sectors of economic activity and social life. The report’s rhetoric seeks to obscure its real intentions, and the claim that it is seeking to strengthen ‘a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment’ is symptomatic. It is full of contradictions and demagoguery, also mentioning that ‘companies, especially [small and medium-sized enterprises] (SMEs), and Europeans’ will be ‘at the heart of the Single Market’. Indeed, they are sure to be at the heart of the negative consequences, which have become so evident during the recent decades of the Single Market. The conclusions of the Council of 25 March, and the ‘Euro Plus Pact’, adopted there, are illustrative of the war being openly waged against workers, young people and pensioners, and, in the end, against the general public.","The Commission’s report on the Single Market Act follows on from Mr Monti’s report on ‘A new strategy for the Single Market’.

Zita Gurmai ,S&D,"Mr President, first of all let me congratulate the two co-rapporteurs for this very important and comprehensive report. Not only does it provide a deep analysis of the differentiated integration within the European Union, taking stock of the changes brought by the necessary strengthening of economic governance at EU level, but it also puts forward concrete solutions in a two-step approach: within the current institutional framework, and what could be done later on through Treaty changes. Let me emphasise a few key points in this report, concerning the necessary democratic legitimacy, accountability and transparency. This is a crucial requirement of the different measures adopted to strengthen financial stability and economic governance, and although it has often been underlined, for example in the report ‘Towards a genuine economic and monetary union’, much improvement is needed and expected. This is especially true of parliamentary scrutiny which is often lacking, for example, with regard to the Troika, the EFSF, and of course the ESM. Another point I would like to highlight is the asymmetry that can arise between Member States which have the euro as their currency and the other Member States which do not. It is important for all Member States to remain associated with the mechanism and decisions taken among eurozone members, for the sake of unity and given their implications for the European Union as a whole. Finally, I welcome the strong emphasis put on the necessary strengthening of the social aspect of the EMU and the proposal outlined in the report of expanding the principle of enhanced cooperation to social and employment policies.","Mr President, first of all let me congratulate the two co-rapporteurs for this very important and comprehensive report.

Finally, I welcome the strong emphasis put on the necessary strengthening of the social aspect of the EMU and the proposal outlined in the report of expanding the principle of enhanced cooperation to social and employment policies.","Mr President, first of all let me congratulate the two co-rapporteurs for this very important and comprehensive report. Not only does it provide a deep analysis of the differentiated integration within the European Union, taking stock of the changes brought by the necessary strengthening of economic governance at EU level, but it also puts forward concrete solutions in a two-step approach: within the current institutional framework, and what could be done later on through Treaty changes.

Nuno Melo ,PPE," The designation of a product’s origin is important so that consumers know the exact source of the product that they are buying. It is not correct to designate a given product as originating in the EU when it is only packaged in an EU country, with the other phases of its production carried out in countries that are not in the EU. The new rules adopted will contribute to greater transparency in international trade and to making things clearer for consumers. That is why I voted as I did.","The designation of a product’s origin is important so that consumers know the exact source of the product that they are buying.

Paolo Gentiloni,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Well, my answer would be no, because I think, well first of all, we know that if we look at the global picture, the European Union is not at all the global actor with higher debt. We have global actor with much, much higher debt than the European Union.  And second, I think that we had an obvious increase of debt because of facing the COVID-19 crisis and what happened because of the COVID-19 crisis, so the lockdown, etc., etc., inevitably needed a universal response. If you have to support a large majority of companies, if you have to support jobs all over the countries, it is quite inevitable to have a higher level of debt. But this is not a recipe for our future. We are not proposing this emergency response to that crisis as the way forward, increasing debt to have growth.  To have growth, we need to invest in our priorities to strengthen European competitiveness, to confirm our leadership in the green transition. These actions will allow us to strengthen our growth. Look to our competitors at global level and we see that this competition is open, that we can play our role, that we are not so far from other competitors from this point of view.

Maria João Rodrigues ,S&D,"Mr President, the Dutch Presidency will be confronted with the daunting challenge of responding to the refugee crisis and protecting the Schengen area. But you can be sure that if you want European citizens to be united in this great undertaking, you also need to ensure much stronger recovery. Much stronger recovery means, to start with, an ambitious strategy for growth and jobs, updating Europe 2020 and making the best use of the energy transition and the digital revolution. This is definitely needed. But let me say that the single market is important but it is not enough. You need to ensure that the investment plan will be implemented much more swiftly. You also need to tackle the difficult problems of tax avoidance and tax evasion in Europe. We can no longer go on with the unfair competition between multinationals and SMEs, between Member States. We need to support the Commission action plan on tax policy and make sure that we have full transparency, we have country-by-country reporting and we ensure that taxes are paid where profits are made.  But then we also have another problem, namely the euro area. The euro-area crisis is still there. We cannot be mistaken about this. It is still there which means that the problem is not only stability, but bringing convergence upwards – upward social and economic convergence. To do this you need to make sure that all members of the euro area have similar investment conditions. This will depend on completing the banking union and on providing a proper fiscal capacity for the euro area. This is also an important roadmap for the Dutch Presidency to push for.","Mr President, the Dutch Presidency will be confronted with the daunting challenge of responding to the refugee crisis and protecting the Schengen area.

Mick Wallace,GUE/NGL," – Mr President, it is clear that the current inflation crisis is supply-driven: first by supply chain bottlenecks and now by energy and fuel companies abusing their market power. As millions of Europeans struggle to feed their families and heat their homes, energy and fuel companies make record profits because of price speculation. The European Commission’s recent Winter Economic Forecast is further proof that inflation is being caused by this profit-price spiral and has nothing to do with wage increases, which remain far below the hikes in the cost of living.  The ECB is not managing this crisis. Increasing interest rates prevents both public and private investment, but ultimately hurts low-income earners the most. Mortgage holders will be pushed to their limits and risk defaulting on their loans. To get to the root of this issue, we need to tax these exorbitant corporate profits and we need to help the ordinary people of Europe, through pay rises in line with the cost of living.","– Mr President, it is clear that the current inflation crisis is supply-driven: first by supply chain bottlenecks and now by energy and fuel companies abusing their market power.

Let me also say as an opening statement that the era of Europe’s naïveté and innocence on security matters is over. And I’m very happy that this awakening of the European Union to security is something that happened before the war. We have enacted two massive legislative packages: the Common Entities Resilience Directive and the Network and Information Systems 2 Directive, on which Groothuis was the rapporteur, precisely because we didn’t expect for the war to remind us of the need to act. And I think that for the first time now at the European Union level, we have a robust set of rules that allow us to align protection against digital and physical threats at the same level of intensity and protection. And this is remarkable. This is new, this is remarkable. Is this the answer to all our problems? No. First of all, the political agreements on these two texts have to be incorporated into EU law. But a few hours ago in the College of Commissioners, we adopted a recommendation, a Council recommendation that asked precisely Member States to frontload this new tools and these rules already now. And we are also asking them to enact crisis coordination mechanisms that were absent from the text, because you would remember that the Member States resisted a crisis coordination mechanism; we had to fight in conciliation together to make this happen. So to cut a long story short: yes, we are much better prepared than ever before in the European Union. No, we are not yet where we want to be in the sense of countering every possible threat, especially against the state actors. But we will get there.

Anže Logar,N/A," President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, Madam Commissioner, honourable Members, the Slovenian Presidency has devoted special attention to the Western Balkan partners and their future in the European Union. The region is of great strategic importance for the Union, and maintaining a constructive engagement is key for the region. I am therefore particularly happy to discuss with you the outcome of the EU—Western Balkans Summit in Brdo, hosted by our Presidency and chaired by the President of the European Council, which was a cornerstone event. The summit served to strengthen our ties and stressed the importance of our relations. It allowed us to emphasise that the EU remains the predominant partner and investor in the region. The system and the close partnership during the COVID—19 pandemic were notably underlined. The Union also reconfirmed its commitment to the enlargement process based upon credible reforms by partners, fair and rigorous conditionality and the principle of own merits. The Brdo Declaration, which was agreed at the summit, highlights these themes as well as the other important aspects. Let me recall some key features that were discussed. In order to foster the region’s socio—economic recovery, leaders discussed ways to intensify their engagement, building on concrete deliverables, notably the economic and investment plan and the green agenda for the Western Balkans. The summit also agreed a set of concrete deliverables, such as the agreement on a roadmap towards lowering roaming costs between the EU and the Western Balkans. Let me also recall that fundamental values and principles, notably rule of law, independent justice and strong democratic institutions, remain key. The Union’s assistance will continue to be linked to tangible progress in the area of rule of law and socio—economic reforms, as well as to the Western Balkans partners, adherence to EU values, rules and standards. Inclusive regional cooperation and the strengthening of good neighbourly relations, including with EU Member States, remain important. So does the need to make further efforts to foster reconciliation and regional stability. In order to ensure the stability of the region and strengthen regional cooperation, ways to deepen our security and strategic engagement were also discussed by the leaders. Finally, it was agreed to hold an EU—Western Balkans summit as a regular event in the future, a decision that reaffirms the Union’s shared commitment to reinvigorating and enhancing our political dialogue with the region of the Western Balkans. To conclude, the summit was successful and appreciated by both the EU and the countries of Western Balkans. It was a timely and important event showing our commitment to the shared objective of a strong, stable and united Europe. I would like to take this opportunity to particularly thank the European Parliament for your role in promoting a sustained and constructive engagement with the Western Balkans and in the strengthening of your important ties.

Ivan Štefanec,PPE," – Madam President, dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, SMEs create more than 100 million jobs in the EU and they create also half of European GDP. And also we have to recognise that half of them are family businesses. So family, it is not only a cornerstone of our social life and our development, but also it is the place of work and growth.  However, the current state of SMEs is not very positive. European competitiveness is lagging behind other developed economies. European SMEs have faced significant challenges and hardships due to the pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.  SMEs are facing difficulties in accessing finance, also expressed by declining willingness of banks to lend credit to SMEs. We have to see also that one out of four bankruptcies in the Union are due to invoices not being paid on time. Another challenge is high inflation, unstable energy prices and lack of skilled work on the market.  What can we do? Firstly, we need to revise the Late Payments Directive and urge for a quick procedure. Secondly, we have to increase efforts for the Capital Markets Union and unlock access to credit for SMEs and for Europe’s growth. And thirdly, last but not least, we need to remove at least 25 % of administrative burdens, complete single market, simplify cross-border cooperation, boost participation on public procurement and improve access to labour, skilled persons and digitalisation processes.  So, dear colleagues. SMEs play a crucial role in fostering economic growth, job creation and social cohesion. That is the key message of this resolution. And I do hope that everybody who cares about our future will support it.

Andreas Mölzer ,NI," The European Transparency Initiative was started years ago, but has made limited progress. The publication of recipients of agricultural subsidies, for example, has brought to light the fact that often, these funds go to big business, royal houses, and so on.

As ever, the transparency initiative is largely empty words, which is why I abstained from voting.","The European Transparency Initiative was started years ago, but has made limited progress.

Matteo Salvini,ID," Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, procedure is one thing: we delegate choices regarding trade policy to the Commission, and that is only right. However, the substance of the matter is something else. What we, the group of the Northern League, representing the regions of Northern Italy, are worried about are the decisions on trade, the progressive reduction of duties, the lack of any industrial policy, and concession of advantages to multinationals. In other words, it is acceptable that Parliament should delegate decisions to the Commission at a technical level, but it is not a good thing that we are slaves and victims of the outdated economic and industrial policy of the World Trade Organisation, which favours the large foreign powers, making no effort to defend our manufacturers. I am not sure if you are aware of the number of small and medium-sized enterprises that are closing in Lombardy and Veneto due to trade agreements that offer no protection to our products. It would be a mistake to believe that research and innovation alone will take us very far. There is a real risk that we will become like the countries of Eastern or Northern Europe, the United States or Asia, where all of the shopping malls now belong to the large multinationals. Therefore, as Parliament, we should delegate the power to adopt these acts regarding trade policy to the Commission, in the hope, however, that the Commission will revise, modernise and defend a manufacturing and trade system that will otherwise disappear.

Guido Milana ,S&D," Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report was adopted with a huge majority in Parliament. I voted for it, but I would have liked to vote on something different, something bolder. In my opinion, Parliament has missed an opportunity to go further. It is quite true that the single European railway area can and must result in a much better relationship with consumers than we have had so far. Why stop, however, at a single national regulatory body and not push on towards a single European regulatory body? Why stop short of the issue of unbundling, bringing in a clear separation between ownership and service management? Yes, the budgets have been separated, but probably this time in Parliament it was not this House’s authority to make its voice heard that has prevailed, but rather the representatives of the abundant privilege and competition present today in the European railway market. We will only manage to truly change the fortunes of freight, improve people’s lives, improve the free circulation of goods when this single European space is worthwhile. Essentially, keeping well away from the train tracks is good for the health and not for economic policy; perhaps by getting too close you will get run over.","Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report was adopted with a huge majority in Parliament.

Questo Parlamento nel 2009 si è già espresso con una larga maggioranza votando una relazione d'iniziativa proprio su questo tema, ma è ancora questo tema che non occupa oggi la priorità nell'agenda dell'Unione europea. Questa è un'inazione, è uno schiaffo, un oltraggio alle donne europee, a quelle 500 mila donne del nostro continente che hanno subito questa brutale pratica, è uno schiaffo a 125 milioni di donne nel mondo e a quelle 5 bambine che ogni minuto vengono infibulate e che guardano all'Europa come a una culla dei diritti umani. Sono orgogliosa che il mio paese abbia una legislazione avanzata con una legge approvata nel 2006 che vieta le mutilazioni genitali femminili nel nostro paese prevedendo, contestualmente, la promozione di numerose attività di contrasto e prevenzione verso questa forma di violenza inaccettabile.  Ecco colleghe, Commissario, la parola più importante, il mezzo, lo strumento più forte che noi abbiamo è la prevenzione, contrasto e prevenzione. Ancora una volta sono felice di questo: il mio paese con 4 milioni di euro – cifra non importante ma comunque è sempre un segno, un gesto importante – ha messo in pratica, attraverso il dipartimento di pari opportunità, una campagna d'informazione che si chiama ""Nessuno escluso"" che si rivolge proprio ai genitori immigrati, puntando proprio alla responsabilizzazione rispetto alla decisione di praticare MGF sulle proprie figlie. E ancora un numero verde che sia dedicato principalmente all'accoglienza delle segnalazioni.  E allora l'Unione europea deve puntare a misure concrete, allo scambio di buone pratiche, soprattutto a implementare e a sostenere la risoluzione dell'Assemblea generale delle Nazioni Unite proprio sulle MGF, perché questa inazione dell'Unione europea non può essere che vista soltanto come inattività rispetto a un tema a noi tutte molto caro, ma che è caro soprattutto anche agli uomini, ne sono sicura, sulla violenza contro le donne.","Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, colleghe, oggi voglio richiamare l'attenzione della Commissione europea sulla priorità della violenza contro le donne perché quando parliamo di mutilazioni genitali femminili parliamo di violenza contro le donne.

Olga Sehnalová ,S&D,"Strategií pro vnitřní trh zboží a služeb se Komise otevřeně zavázala bojovat proti diskriminaci spotřebitelů na vnitřním trhu.  Nejen spotřebitelská centra od spotřebitelů často dostávají stížnosti týkající se neodůvodněných rozdílů v zacházení na základě státní příslušnosti nebo bydliště. Jakákoli forma diskriminace spotřebitelů na základě jejich národnosti nebo země pobytu je pro mě absolutně nepřípustná a proti samotné myšlence vnitřního trhu.  Velmi proto vítám, že usnesení stávající formy diskriminace rázně odmítá, a to jak v elektronickém prostředí, tak mimo něj.

Věra Jourová,N/A," Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, thank you very much for this debate. I am really thankful for the fact that we still have in fresh memory what Ursula von der Leyen said here in this place yesterday. I would like to refer to that because I agree with those of you who said something like bad times cannot be cured by nice words only. We are not only speaking, we are planning and we are doing very concrete things, short term and longer term. And the President spoke about almost all of the current problems. First of all, short term: the data is clear. SMEs are under extreme pressure already after COVID and now with the war with extremely high energy prices and inflation. We have obligation to help them, short term. And I think that Ursula von der Leyen was very clear by presenting the solutions which should help in this current very critical situation. She also spoke very clearly – although not in detail – about the medium—term and longer—term measures. First of all, the SME relief package. What she had in mind was securing cash flow. That is why she announced the Commission to revise the Late Payment Directive. Then simplifying doing business in the single market. We will make a proposal for a single set of tax rules for doing business in Europe called BEFIT. And third, we need to look into skills and access to finance. It also resonated here in this debate that the access to finance should be much easier. I am always upset when I see that the rules for financing are extremely complicated. And honestly, I see more complications added by the Member States than in the original proposals of the EU. And then, OK so what is the solution for that? So let’s pay, from taxpayers’ money, the advisers to help. Why don’t we simplify? It would be much cheaper. So I think that these are the things we have to focus on. On behalf of the Commission, I want to say something on regulatory burden, because indeed we are now applying the one-in, one-out. We are assessing whether the new legislation is bringing new obligations and new burdens. And we are looking into the older legislation which should be amended at least to balance it or decrease the burdens. And it goes slowly but surely. And I can tell you, it requires a lot of vigilance, because in every new proposal, we have to test the impact and we are testing the impact on the SMEs and we try to apply the test of proportionality and necessity. But at the same time I have to say that throughout the legislative process I see the lack of this vigilance. What I see are invisible small steps which are adding more and more burdens on SMEs. And I think that it requires the vigilance of all of us that we have to say from time to time, let’s stop this madness, we don’t need this and that reporting from the companies around 10 employees or 20 employees. And I could give you very concrete examples, but due to the time shortage I will not do that. But it requires a proactive approach and proactive vigilance against this small, invisible process of adding the burdens. I would call it ‘killing me softly’, with reference to a famous song. We must be very much more active not to let this happen further. In my previous job I was the Minister of Regional Development. I spoke to many SMEs about the situation. Almost all of them were complaining about bureaucracy and regulatory burdens, and when I asked them as the Minister, what can I do for you? The answer was, very often, ‘forget that we exist, do not do anything for us. Just let us do the business. Give us clear and simple rules. That’s it. That’s all we need.’ If we do not do that, we will keep biting the hand which is feeding us because we heard many times here the data which show that SMEs are the biggest employers in the EU. So what I call, on behalf of the Commission, we try to do that, but also I call on the co-legislators to remain vigilant and to always do the test of proportionality and necessity whenever we are adopting new legislation.","Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, thank you very much for this debate.

Hans-Peter Martin ,NI," Mr President, we need democratic revolution. That is clear from this process, which has luckily gained momentum with what is presently the G20, because more may join; one could even imagine a G3. How would it be if the Council helped in establishing a democratic control mechanism, especially given its tradition of consensus? It need not be a world parliament straight away, but what is being promoted needs democratic scrutiny by elected parliamentarians within a far bigger forum than the European Parliament. I should also like to specifically point out that the question of systemic risks must be approached at its core. With reference in particular to the tiresome situation we keep finding ourselves in, starting back in 1998, with LTCM, Hypo Real Estate and, of course, Lehman, and the knock-on effects, rules should emerge from this that make it impossible to end up with the basic problem of ‘too big to fail’. This can, of course, be done through cartel legislation, but it is certainly also a fundamental global question. As far as a global transaction tax is concerned, the Tobin tax group was set up here in the European Parliament back in 1999. It is good that there has been progress here. As far as the supervisory package is concerned, we urgently need to act on a European scale and not to allow ourselves to be held back by those who want the wrong Europe.","Mr President, we need democratic revolution.

Tunne Kelam ,PPE,"I voted in favour of both reports on shale gas. Energy independence should be one of the EU’s most important geopolitical goals and therefore it is crucial that Member states can make their own decisions on energy. Should energy decisions also affect other Member States, the opinions and the European dimension need to be taken into account – as often emphasized by Parliament. This protects the sovereignty of Member States in their choices of energy and allows for the diversification of energy sources – which is crucial for the Member States who are currently dependant to a large extent on one country as a major energy provider, Russia. The Sonik report clearly points out that fears and prejudices against shale gas and its environmental and health impact are mostly ungrounded, as long as the highest environmental and safety standards are applied. Unnecessary propaganda creating fears in regard to shale gas, but also nuclear power, is irresponsible. We have to guarantee the highest safety and ensure there are no negative effects on the environment or on health, but people must also have a warm house and lighting at affordable prices. We need alternative energy and shale gas might be the solution at the moment.","I voted in favour of both reports on shale gas.

Jiří Maštálka ,GUE/NGL," I should like to say a few words. Those who are well informed know that debates on the future shape of this policy are now starting to become more intense. Sometimes, the question is even raised as to whether this policy should exist at all. The cohesion policy has its supporters, but also its critics. I would like to mention the fundamental idea behind the creation of the cohesion policy in 1974 – the principle of solidarity between the economically more advanced and the economically weaker areas. In the EU, significant differences remain, and until they are evened out, the problem-free implementation of the idea of free movement of services or capital is unthinkable. There are a number of expert studies showing that the cohesion policy functions in principle, and creates the desired added value, and I therefore see critical voices more as a warning against procedural failures and a call for improvement in the future. We know that the situation has changed since 1974 and that the cohesion policy is now an important instrument for the development of European regions and towns. This is also a strong argument for it to continue and to encompass the entire territory of the EU. It is necessary to have a discussion on the level of support in different regions, which will result from negotiations between the Council and Parliament. I trust that the Commission will come forward with good proposals. I would like to express my firm belief that with the right set-up, the critics will fall silent and will defend the existence of the cohesion policy for all EU citizens.","I should like to say a few words.

Janusz Władysław Zemke ,S&D," Mr President, I should like to draw attention to the following fact: the sulphur content of marine fuels has been falling steadily for several years. This is a welcome trend, because it improves the quality of people’s lives and protects the environment. This also applies to the Baltic Sea and the countries which lie around it, so it also applies to Poland. It should be noted, however, that the reduction in sulphur content now being proposed is to be a severe one. Only a few years ago, the sulphur limit for fuel was 1.5%, today it is 1%, and in a few years, it is to be 0.1%, so there is to be a tenfold decrease. Such a requirement puts many of Europe’s shipowners in a very difficult situation, and the cost of fuel, which will have to be higher because it is going to be of better quality, may reduce the competitiveness of this form of transport. These shipowners should therefore be given technical and financial assistance, and this is something which should be provided by the Union and, in particular, by Parliament.","Mr President, I should like to draw attention to the following fact: the sulphur content of marine fuels has been falling steadily for several years.

Danilo Oscar Lancini,ID," – Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, il vero significato di questo accordo è politico più che commerciale, lo sappiamo tutti. Dobbiamo puntare a migliorare le relazioni con gli Stati Uniti, allentando le tensioni commerciali e sostenendo un'equa risoluzione delle controversie in corso. Gli Stati Uniti sono il primo mercato per i prodotti agricoli e alimentari dell'UE, sono la destinazione più importante per l'export di prodotti di qualità ad alto valore aggiunto. Com'è noto, la disputa relativa ai sussidi Airbus e Boeing ha portato ad aumenti tariffari su numerosi prodotti europei esportati negli Stati Uniti. Questi aumenti sono andati a colpire prodotti di paesi che non partecipano al consorzio Airbus e settori assolutamente non collegati alla disputa, come l'agroalimentare, dove già i prodotti europei sono penalizzati da importazioni che non rispettano le nostre stesse regole. Vista la recente sentenza dell'Organizzazione mondiale del commercio, che ha autorizzato l'Europa ad applicare dazi sui prodotti e servizi USA per 4 miliardi di dollari, occorre, a maggior ragione, avviare un dialogo costruttivo ed evitare qualsiasi tipo di escalation che avrebbe effetti non prevedibili e preoccupanti in un momento particolarmente delicato per l'economia per via degli effetti della pandemia. Ricordo che, sempre il settore agroalimentare, sei anni fa è stato vittima delle controsanzioni russe in risposta all'appoggio europeo agli Stati Uniti sulle sanzioni alla Federazione russa, con una perdita complessiva al 2017 del settore agricolo e dell'industria alimentare europei di circa 5,5 miliardi di euro e un danno riportato all'agroalimentare made in Italy di circa un miliardo di euro al 2020.

Paul Murphy ,GUE/NGL,"Mr President, if you are not considered human, human rights do not apply to you. They are the words of Moni Rani Das, a Bangladeshi Dalit women’s activist. I think they sum up the problem facing 260 million people affected by caste-based discrimination. The stories that you hear are horrific: the countless rapes of young women to which police turn a blind eye; the story of Chanchal Kumari, a 19-year-old student who suffered a vicious acid attack simply for daring to ignore teenage boys; or the heart-breaking stories of young children who cannot understand why other children refuse to play with them. But of course caste discrimination, as has been mentioned, is not confined to Asia. In Britain the disgraceful attempts of the government to block or delay the extension of equality legislation to include caste-based discrimination should be condemned. While it is illegal in most countries, it does not stop human rights violations, exclusion, torture, rape, slavery and murder being a daily reality for many. But the growing number of brave, oppressed caste activists raising their voices shows a way forward. Linked with the struggles of other workers and the poor, an alternative society based on equality and solidarity can be built and this barbaric feudal remnant can be consigned to the dustbin of history.","Mr President, if you are not considered human, human rights do not apply to you.

They are the words of Moni Rani Das, a Bangladeshi Dalit women’s activist. I think they sum up the problem facing 260 million people affected by caste-based discrimination.

Naomi Long,ALDE," – Madam President, for me, today is a historic day but one of profound regret at the departure of the United Kingdom from its place of influence within the European Union. I will vote against the Withdrawal Agreement today to record the continued opposition of those whom I represent to this insular, isolationist and reckless course of action. But I want to place on record my thanks to Michel Barnier and his team for all they have done to mitigate that recklessness. The people of Northern Ireland rejected Brexit in 2016, and we are certainly not accepting it now. (President: Could I just ask: we need to listen to the speakers, and there’s a lot of people to my right here who are having a great old chat. There’s a restaurant outside: go for a coffee. This is Ms Long’s last speech here in the Parliament. Please listen with respect.) Whilst the UK may withdraw from these institutions, the people of Northern Ireland will never withdraw the hand of friendship, the spirit of cooperation, or the shared determination to secure peace and prosperity for all of our people. As a child of the Northern Ireland conflict, I’m grateful to the European Union, which helped shape our peace and which provides a model for pragmatic win-win politics based not on division but upon diversity. The decisions you make in this place will continue to shape the lives of the people I represent, and I look forward to forging new ways of ensuring that those close and enduring partnerships built between Northern Ireland and this place flourish. Finally, whilst we will no longer be colleagues in these institutions, I remain your steadfast colleague outside of them, as together we continue to champion the values of cooperation, interdependence and mutual respect which the European Union represents, until one day we rejoin you here. Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen, slán go fóill, good-bye for now.

Presidente,N/A,"Signore e signori, onorevoli colleghi, il premio Sacharov è stato assegnato nel 2010 a Guillermo Fariñas. All'epoca, egli non ha potuto partecipare alla cerimonia di premiazione.  Sono particolarmente lieto di porgere un caloroso benvenuto a Guillermo Fariñas Hernandez qui al Parlamento europeo. Il fatto che egli sia presente in questi giorni al Parlamento europeo ci permette di insignirlo del premio di persona. Desideriamo riconoscere e lodare i suoi sforzi costanti ed eccezionali nel sostenere la lotta per la libertà a Cuba ed il suo impegno a favore dei principi e valori democratici.  Vorrei inoltre porgere un benvenuto caloroso e particolarmente affettuoso alla sig.ra Alicia Hernandez Cabeza, che ha fatto un lungo viaggio fino al Parlamento europeo per essere al fianco di suo figlio in questa occasione speciale. Credo che tutti noi possiamo facilmente immaginare il suo dolore, la sua pena e la sua tristezza quando suo figlio è stato incarcerato e durante i suoi frequenti scioperi della fame. In questi anni ha trovato la forza e il coraggio di restare al fianco del figlio e di sostenerlo nella sua battaglia per la libertà. Vorrei ora rivolgermi direttamente al sig. Fariñas. Caro combattente per la libertà, le tue forti convinzioni e la tua attività politica ti sono costati più di 11 anni di prigione e 23 scioperi della fame. Ti do del tu, se me lo consenti. Sei il terzo cittadino cubano ad essere insignito del Premio Sacharov per la libertà di pensiero, dopo il defunto e compianto Oswaldo Paya nel 2002, e le ""Damas de Blanco"" nel 2005.  Nel 2010, quando il Parlamento europeo ti assegnò il Premio Sacharov, tu avevi dichiarato, cito le tue parole: ""Non si tratta di un premio per Guillermo Fariñas, ma per tutta la dissidenza cubana"".  Esistono diversi modi di lottare per la libertà, in particolare per la libertà di pensiero. In tante occasioni tu hai scelto lo sciopero della fame come arma per manifestare conto la dittatura del tuo paese, hai messo la tua stessa salute a rischio e lo hai fatto più di una volta con grande coraggio. La tua tenacia ti è quasi costata la vita, ma nel contempo hai costretto il governo cubano ad acconsentire al rilascio di 52 prigionieri politici. Da alcuni mesi ti è stato permesso di viaggiare all'estero e di proseguire la tua lotta al di là dei confini di Cuba. Tu non sei da solo in questo lungo viaggio verso la libertà e la democrazia. Come esempio concreto del suo sostegno a favore dello sviluppo della democrazia nel tuo paese, nel corso degli anni il Parlamento europeo ha adottato diverse risoluzioni su Cuba, con cui ha ribadito la sua condanna nei confronti delle violazioni dei diritti umani.  A tale proposito vorrei ricordare alcuni dati inaccettabili: in totale, nel 2012 la commissione cubana dei diritti umani ha documentato 6 602 casi di arresti arbitrari a breve termine, ossia il 50% in più rispetto al 2011. Nonostante un contesto preoccupante, vorremmo restare ottimisti e sperare che il popolo cubano possa un giorno godere della libertà e della prosperità.  Ti posso assicurare, caro Guillermo, che l'Unione europea e il suo Parlamento assisteranno il popolo cubano e le sue aspirazioni alla democrazia ed esprimeranno sempre il loro forte sostegno alla libertà di pensiero a Cuba e ovunque nel mondo. Signor Fariñas, caro Guillermo, vorrei rivolgerti un pensiero di gratitudine, usando le parole di Martin Luther King: ""Ci sono uomini che scrivono la storia, ci sono uomini che leggono la storia e ci sono uomini che fanno la storia"". Tu con il tuo esempio fai la storia del diritto inalienabile al rispetto della dignità e della libertà.  Per questo ti è stato assegnato il Premio Sacharov che è il premio per la libertà di pensiero.

Herman Van Rompuy,N/A,"Mr President, after a brief, but heartfelt, welcome of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union, which was felt by all to be a tribute to past work and an invitation to redouble our efforts for the future, the focus of last week’s European Council was on the economic issues, namely the implementation of the Compact on Growth and Jobs approved last June and the discussion on the interim report on deepening economic and monetary union (EMU). We also spent time on some foreign policy questions and touched on a matter which I know is of concern here, the appointment to the vacant seat on the Board of the European Central Bank, which was raised both by me and by your President in his speech at the beginning of the meeting. The Union’s commitment to promoting the equality of women and men is an objective laid down in the Treaty. Yesterday’s vote by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the appointment is an understandable expression of concern that a great deal remains to be achieved, notably regarding the European Central Bank. But I note also the committee’s recognition that the candidate’s professional competences are in no way in dispute. For my part, at last week’s European Council, I made a strong appeal to all Heads of State or Government to identify and propose female candidates for vacant posts at European level, in particular in the economic and financial sectors, where the under-representation of women is blatant. I underlined that we need to be active in encouraging this process. I hope that, with such renewed commitment to gender balance, Parliament will base its final decision on the current candidate for the ECB executive board on the sole criteria of professional qualification and experience. It is urgent to fill that vacancy. Now let me move on to the economic questions which were at the core of our discussions. First, growth and jobs. We are still suffering from a lack of growth – 25 million people are unemployed in the Union, many of whom are young people. Overall growth projections for next year are at best modest. I am painfully aware of the toll this is taking on our societies. In several countries, the adjustment is more severe and lengthy than many had expected. Reining in budgetary deficits and restoring competitiveness would have been necessary even without the crisis in the eurozone. It is therefore all the more necessary to share the burden of this adjustment fairly and to have policies especially targeted at reducing unemployment. Here, the EU instruments can and should assist. Creating jobs and boosting socially-inclusive growth remains our utmost priority and our ultimate goal. The commitments made under the Compact for Growth and Jobs cannot wait: they must be followed by decisive action and translated into concrete results. This is particularly urgent for the implementation of the EUR 120 billion package we agreed in June, for progress on the single market issues and on our EU-2020 goals. It is also urgent for measures supporting social inclusion, promoting research and development, developing the competitiveness of our industries, and harnessing the potential of international trade. In the meanwhile, we will discuss in November the multiannual financial framework at the European Council. We need a growth-oriented EU budget. Although it represents only 1 % of European GDP, it can, as an investment budget, have a huge impact on growth. Of course, restoring confidence in the eurozone is a key part of bringing back internal demand and growth. On this, we can now witness the first results of our cumulative actions. Let me give a few examples. The so-called spreads are decreasing significantly in almost all eurozone countries. Public deficits are now lower in most countries. Competitiveness and export performances are stronger in all countries. The upcoming common bank supervisor is a major breakthrough and we launched two weeks ago the European Stability Mechanism so that our ‘firewall’ now amounts to EUR 700 billion. In the specific case of Greece, significant progress has been made. The eurozone Heads of State and Government issued a statement welcoming the determination of the Greek Government to deliver on its commitments and also commending the remarkable efforts of the Greek people. The Eurogroup will examine this progress in light of the forthcoming troika report and take any necessary decisions. Our second major debate was on the interim report which I drew up in collaboration with the Presidents of the Commission, the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank – a group of four presidents who also met with your President, Martin Schulz. My office also consulted Member States and the European Parliament’s delegation, whose contribution was significant. I also personally met some of your rapporteurs, coordinators and committee chairs. This was an interim report seeking to clarify concepts and test the level of support for various ideas that have arisen, with the aim of reaching conclusions in December. It highlighted points of convergence and outlined areas that would require further work. The European Council gave a mandate to continue this work and propose a specific and time-bound roadmap to be presented at its December meeting so that it can move ahead on all the essential building blocks on which genuine EMU should be based. Our immediate priority was progress on financial integration. In June, we agreed to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns. The urgent element now is setting up a single supervisory mechanism (SSM) to prevent banking risks and cross-border contagion from emerging. That is why the European Council called for swift progress, with the objective of agreeing on the legislative framework by 1 January 2013. Once this is agreed, the SSM could become effectively operational during 2013. This places a huge responsibility on all of us to meet this ambitious timeline. We cannot afford to risk losing momentum. When establishing a Supervisor, several aspects need to be taken into consideration. First, there must be a clear separation between the monetary responsibilities of the ECB and its supervisory functions. The ECB should be able to carry out supervision directly in a differentiated manner, meaning using national authorities in supervisory tasks as much as possible. The SSM will be designed and implemented with the integrity of the single market for financial services in mind. Finally, the mechanism should be inclusive and transparent: all Member States are free and invited to join. This openness should be reflected in the governance structure, with appropriate rights and obligations for all. The SSM is a first, essential step towards a complete, integrated framework for the financial sector. Other steps also need to be taken quickly, starting with harmonising national resolution and deposit guarantee schemes, following which the Commission will propose a single resolution mechanism. As agreed in June, direct recapitalisation by the European Stability Mechanism will be possible once an effective SSM has been established. We asked the Eurogroup to draw up the exact operational criteria. For a stable economic and monetary union, we also need stronger integrated frameworks for budgetary matters and economic policies. On both these fronts we have already done a lot. Let me put it this way: if we fully use all our tools – the six-pack, the forthcoming two-pack, the European Semester with its country specific recommendations, the new macroeconomic imbalance procedure and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance – then we will have already taken a major step towards fiscal and economic union. Yet to secure the eurozone’s long-term stability, we also need to be able to better deal with economic shocks and spur economic convergence. Here, some new avenues in my report attracted attention. I received a mandate, together with my colleagues, to explore them further between now and December. One of these is that Member States could enter into individual arrangements of a contractual nature with the EU institutions on the reforms they commit to make, in response to the country specific recommendations of the Council, to promote growth and jobs. Another is the possibility of an appropriate fiscal capacity for the euro area. This new idea requires further exploration and it was agreed that this is unrelated – I emphasise ‘unrelated’ – to the preparation of the next multiannual financial framework. It will be crucial for the new EMU to be fully legitimate and accountable. As a general principle, we all agree that democratic control should occur at the level where decisions are taken. It is also important to build this deeper economic and monetary union on the EU’s institutional and legal frameworks, and to make sure that it remains open and transparent towards Member States outside the eurozone. As in all our regular European Councils, I wanted to devote some time to strategic discussions on our external relations and our foreign policy. We focused on two main issues. First, our relations with China – taking a step back and looking at the long term. I debriefed the European Council on the September Summit with China, a very positive one. As you know, this key partner is undergoing a ‘once in a decade’ leadership change. We exchanged views on how to engage constructively with the new leadership. We must pass on the same messages to Beijing, both the easy and the difficult ones, in our contacts at all levels. China presented a package of proposals for future cooperation between the EU and China. We will respond in the same spirit with our own proposals. We will come back to this issue to prepare the next summit, which should take place in China in autumn 2013. Second, we addressed crisis areas in the world: Syria, Iran and Mali. This was indeed the first time that we had discussed developments in Mali at European Council level. The situation has a security, humanitarian and regional impact on the Sahel. It could also become a threat to our own societies and to our own security. The Union is contributing to the international efforts led by the United Nations to stabilise the situation. We decided to accelerate our own planning for a possible European military crisis management operation and support for the international military force, in accordance with the recent UN Security Council Resolution 2071. To conclude, this was a positive summit. It is good for Europe that we will have a single supervisory mechanism up and running in the course of 2013. Between now and December we will work on further progress to reinforce our economic and monetary union. The biggest contribution to growth in the short term is restoring confidence in the eurozone.","Mr President, after a brief, but heartfelt, welcome of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union, which was felt by all to be a tribute to past work and an invitation to redouble our efforts for the future, the focus of last week’s European Council was on the economic issues, namely the implementation of the Compact on Growth and Jobs approved last June and the discussion on the interim report on deepening economic and monetary union .

For my part, at last week’s European Council, I made a strong appeal to all Heads of State or Government to identify and propose female candidates for vacant posts at European level, in particular in the economic and financial sectors, where the under-representation of women is blatant. I underlined that we need to be active in encouraging this process. I hope that, with such renewed commitment to gender balance, Parliament will base its final decision on the current candidate for the ECB executive board on the sole criteria of professional qualification and experience. It is urgent to fill that vacancy. Now let me move on to the economic questions which were at the core of our discussions. First, growth and jobs. We are still suffering from a lack of growth – 25 million people are unemployed in the Union, many of whom are young people. Overall growth projections for next year are at best modest. I am painfully aware of the toll this is taking on our societies. In several countries, the adjustment is more severe and lengthy than many had expected. Reining in budgetary deficits and restoring competitiveness would have been necessary even without the crisis in the eurozone. It is therefore all the more necessary to share the burden of this adjustment fairly and to have policies especially targeted at reducing unemployment. Here, the EU instruments can and should assist. Creating jobs and boosting socially-inclusive growth remains our utmost priority and our ultimate goal. The commitments made under the Compact for Growth and Jobs cannot wait: they must be followed by decisive action and translated into concrete results. This is particularly urgent for the implementation of the EUR 120 billion package we agreed in June, for progress on the single market issues and on our EU-2020 goals. It is also urgent for measures supporting social inclusion, promoting research and development, developing the competitiveness of our industries, and harnessing the potential of international trade. In the meanwhile, we will discuss in November the multiannual financial framework at the European Council. We need a growth-oriented EU budget. Although it represents only 1 % of European GDP, it can, as an investment budget, have a huge impact on growth. Of course, restoring confidence in the eurozone is a key part of bringing back internal demand and growth. On this, we can now witness the first results of our cumulative actions. Let me give a few examples. The so-called spreads are decreasing significantly in almost all eurozone countries. Public deficits are now lower in most countries. Competitiveness and export performances are stronger in all countries. The upcoming common bank supervisor is a major breakthrough and we launched two weeks ago the European Stability Mechanism so that our ‘firewall’ now amounts to EUR 700 billion. In the specific case of Greece, significant progress has been made. The eurozone Heads of State and Government issued a statement welcoming the determination of the Greek Government to deliver on its commitments and also commending the remarkable efforts of the Greek people. The Eurogroup will examine this progress in light of the forthcoming troika report and take any necessary decisions. Our second major debate was on the interim report which I drew up in collaboration with the Presidents of the Commission, the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank – a group of four presidents who also met with your President, Martin Schulz. My office also consulted Member States and the European Parliament’s delegation, whose contribution was significant. I also personally met some of your rapporteurs, coordinators and committee chairs. This was an interim report seeking to clarify concepts and test the level of support for various ideas that have arisen, with the aim of reaching conclusions in December. It highlighted points of convergence and outlined areas that would require further work. The European Council gave a mandate to continue this work and propose a specific and time-bound roadmap to be presented at its December meeting so that it can move ahead on all the essential building blocks on which genuine EMU should be based. Our immediate priority was progress on financial integration. In June, we agreed to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns. The urgent element now is setting up a single supervisory mechanism to prevent banking risks and cross-border contagion from emerging. That is why the European Council called for swift progress, with the objective of agreeing on the legislative framework by 1 January 2013. Once this is agreed, the SSM could become effectively operational during 2013. This places a huge responsibility on all of us to meet this ambitious timeline. We cannot afford to risk losing momentum. When establishing a Supervisor, several aspects need to be taken into consideration. First, there must be a clear separation between the monetary responsibilities of the ECB and its supervisory functions. The ECB should be able to carry out supervision directly in a differentiated manner, meaning using national authorities in supervisory tasks as much as possible. The SSM will be designed and implemented with the integrity of the single market for financial services in mind. Finally, the mechanism should be inclusive and transparent: all Member States are free and invited to join. This openness should be reflected in the governance structure, with appropriate rights and obligations for all. The SSM is a first, essential step towards a complete, integrated framework for the financial sector. Other steps also need to be taken quickly, starting with harmonising national resolution and deposit guarantee schemes, following which the Commission will propose a single resolution mechanism. As agreed in June, direct recapitalisation by the European Stability Mechanism will be possible once an effective SSM has been established. We asked the Eurogroup to draw up the exact operational criteria. For a stable economic and monetary union, we also need stronger integrated frameworks for budgetary matters and economic policies. On both these fronts we have already done a lot. Let me put it this way: if we fully use all our tools – the six-pack, the forthcoming two-pack, the European Semester with its country specific recommendations, the new macroeconomic imbalance procedure and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance – then we will have already taken a major step towards fiscal and economic union. Yet to secure the eurozone’s long-term stability, we also need to be able to better deal with economic shocks and spur economic convergence. Here, some new avenues in my report attracted attention. I received a mandate, together with my colleagues, to explore them further between now and December. One of these is that Member States could enter into individual arrangements of a contractual nature with the EU institutions on the reforms they commit to make, in response to the country specific recommendations of the Council, to promote growth and jobs. Another is the possibility of an appropriate fiscal capacity for the euro area. This new idea requires further exploration and it was agreed that this is unrelated – I emphasise ‘unrelated’ – to the preparation of the next multiannual financial framework. It will be crucial for the new EMU to be fully legitimate and accountable. As a general principle, we all agree that democratic control should occur at the level where decisions are taken. It is also important to build this deeper economic and monetary union on the EU’s institutional and legal frameworks, and to make sure that it remains open and transparent towards Member States outside the eurozone. As in all our regular European Councils, I wanted to devote some time to strategic discussions on our external relations and our foreign policy. We focused on two main issues. First, our relations with China – taking a step back and looking at the long term. I debriefed the European Council on the September Summit with China, a very positive one. As you know, this key partner is undergoing a ‘once in a decade’ leadership change. We exchanged views on how to engage constructively with the new leadership. We must pass on the same messages to Beijing, both the easy and the difficult ones, in our contacts at all levels. China presented a package of proposals for future cooperation between the EU and China. We will respond in the same spirit with our own proposals. We will come back to this issue to prepare the next summit, which should take place in China in autumn 2013. Second, we addressed crisis areas in the world: Syria, Iran and Mali. This was indeed the first time that we had discussed developments in Mali at European Council level. The situation has a security, humanitarian and regional impact on the Sahel. It could also become a threat to our own societies and to our own security. The Union is contributing to the international efforts led by the United Nations to stabilise the situation. We decided to accelerate our own planning for a possible European military crisis management operation and support for the international military force, in accordance with the recent UN Security Council Resolution 2071. To conclude, this was a positive summit. It is good for Europe that we will have a single supervisory mechanism up and running in the course of 2013. Between now and December we will work on further progress to reinforce our economic and monetary union. The biggest contribution to growth in the short term is restoring confidence in the eurozone.","Mr President, after a brief, but heartfelt, welcome of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union, which was felt by all to be a tribute to past work and an invitation to redouble our efforts for the future, the focus of last week’s European Council was on the economic issues, namely the implementation of the Compact on Growth and Jobs approved last June and the discussion on the interim report on deepening economic and monetary union .

Inés Ayala Sender ,S&D," Mr President, exactly eight years ago this November, the Prestige, an oil tanker carrying 70 000 tonnes of crude oil, suffered an accident off the coast of Galicia causing a leak through which the tanker spilled 20 000 tonnes of oil. This initial leak, combined with the misjudged decisions of the Minister of Public Works at the time, Mr Álvarez-Cascos, resulted in an absolute disaster and the worst ecological, social and economic tragedy ever to affect the Galician coasts. One of the possible causes considered to explain the leak was precisely the presence of lost containers floating on the sea surface at the mercy of the waves and storms. These containers are potential projectiles that can be thrust against the hulls of all kinds of ships, including oil tankers like the Prestige but also passenger ships, ferries or cruise ships. The outcome of the Lashing@Sea project has revealed serious deficiencies and negligence in the different areas concerned, such as lack of training and instruction among loading personnel and stevedores in the ports and also among the ship crews, which are consistently undertrained and undermanned even though the ships they work on are genuine monsters of the seas. In addition, the best techniques to secure and trace the containers are, on the whole, insufficiently used, and they are frequently overloaded. Lastly, a cost and risk assessment of the new physical effects generated by these monsters of the seas needs to be carried out. These effects include, for example, the so-called ‘parametric resonance effect’, which can cause containers to drop from the rear of the ship at a faster rate. This is why we demand that the European Commission undertake immediate preventive measures, more training, instruction and refreshment courses for stevedores and crews. We also demand the implementation of technological safety measures: weight controls in ports, improved lashing equipment and stacking strategies, and adequate marking to locate the containers in case of loss, traceability being one of the services potentially provided by the Galileo project.","Mr President, exactly eight years ago this November, the Prestige, an oil tanker carrying 70 000 tonnes of crude oil, suffered an accident off the coast of Galicia causing a leak through which the tanker spilled 20 000 tonnes of oil.

Molly Scott Cato ,Greens/EFA,"Madam President, during the referendum campaign, I argued that the European Union has played a vital role in underpinning stability and democracy across our continent. We should not take our democratic rights for granted and I am shocked by the instability and divisions that the vote to leave, and the campaign itself, have caused in my country. Many of those who voted for the UK to leave the EU did so for principled reasons, some of which I agree with, but I think it would be dangerously politically naive to ignore the fact that, within the current wave of inarticulate hostility against the European Union, there are forces whose intention is not to reform our institutions, but to undermine democracy itself. As a result of the vote to leave the EU, my country is left without a government or opposition and with a frightening increase in the number of racist attacks. I have no doubt that we will return to a state of stable democratic governance but, in the meantime, I offer some reassurance to those who are unsettled by recent developments. As individuals, please wear the safety pin, to show that we stand together against the tiny minority of racists, whether you voted to leave or to remain. As Greens, we will fight to ensure that EU citizens already living in the UK will be allowed to stay and we insist that they are treated respectfully. We will also do our utmost to achieve an electoral system in which votes are translated into seats fairly, so that nobody feels their voice is unheard and politicians act as true representatives. Finally, we will ensure that our decision to leave the EU is not used as an excuse to launch a race to the bottom in terms of environmental standards, taxation and workers’ rights.

Corina Creţu ,S&D," The manner in which the second round of Presidential elections in Côte d’Ivoire took place is regrettable. Violence, resulting in deaths and injuries, eventually led to the evacuation of international observers, a fact that raises a big question mark over the correctness of this poll, but also over the post-electoral progress in this country. I hope that this country, which was once a model of democracy for the African continent, will successfully rise above the impasse of electoral confrontation. Massive participation at the ballot box, despite the tensions, expresses the major preoccupation of the Ivoirians for the future of their country. I therefore believe that it is essential for the will of the citizens, expressed by voting in an election that has been cancelled six times in the past, to be respected. Côte d’Ivoire has the chance to bring to an end a decade of political, military and provisional government crises that divided the country into loyalist south and rebellious north. The only viable solution is for the will of the electorate to be respected.","The manner in which the second round of Presidential elections in Côte d’Ivoire took place is regrettable.

Radan Kanev,PPE," – Mr President, dear Commissioner, Minister, colleagues, let me be, as usual, very straightforward. I am deeply concerned by the ease and speed with which the Council, including my own government, approved the windfall tax. I am concerned because a windfall tax does not necessarily reduce bills, which is the theme of our debate, but rather subsidises the most unsustainable of all forms of electric generation – those from natural gas, it distorts natural market incentives and eventually jeopardises the business plans and investments of more sustainable and viable alternatives. And I am extremely concerned by the populist zeal with which this House discusses extension of the windfall tax to other businesses. It is market—based innovation and competition that could lead us out of this crisis, and not breaking the free market.","– Mr President, dear Commissioner, Minister, colleagues, let me be, as usual, very straightforward.

Nicola Danti,S&D," – Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, signora Commissaria, negli ultimi mesi abbiamo assistito a una escalation delle frizioni commerciali tra Stati Uniti ed Europa: prima i dazi imposti sulle nostre importazioni di acciaio e alluminio, poi la ritorsione americana a seguito della sentenza Airbus. Trump sta evidentemente utilizzando i dazi per creare consenso elettorale in vista delle prossime presidenziali. Nei prossimi mesi arriverà un'analoga sentenza OMC sui sussidi americani erogati alla Boeing, che ci permetterà di imporre dazi a nostra volta. In questo scenario dobbiamo essere capaci di mettere a freno questa guerra commerciale. Da questo braccio di ferro non uscirà alcun vincitore. I benefici temporanei sono solo un'illusione, le due economie ne soffriranno in modo significativo. La via da percorrere sta nella ricerca di un dialogo politico.

Vito Bonsignore ,PPE," I voted in favour of the aforementioned report because I think that bolstering professional skills and participation in the labour market is an essential tool for a Europe intending to continue its journey to economic, financial and social recovery. Under the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Commission has set an EU-wide goal of achieving 75% employment in the 20-64 age group, thereby guaranteeing the sustainability of welfare systems and not insignificant improvement in the public finances of the EU Member States. I therefore think that, in tandem with the approach set out by the Commission and very much in support of Ms Bastos’s position, there are further margins for improvement. I am therefore voting in favour of a report that aims to provide further support for the implementation of specific measures designed to ensure the availability of qualified labour, reduce structural unemployment, improve labour market functioning – making it inclusive – and improving job quality and working conditions.","I voted in favour of the aforementioned report because I think that bolstering professional skills and participation in the labour market is an essential tool for a Europe intending to continue its journey to economic, financial and social recovery.

Svenja Hahn,ALDE," – Frau Präsidentin, liebe Kollegen! Wir haben es gerade von Kommissarin McGuinness gehört: China liefert 98 % unserer Seltenen Erden, Türkei 98 % des Borats, Südafrika 71 % unseres Platins.

Nessa Childers ,S&D,"Mr President, I congratulate my colleague, Linda McAvan, on her report. With almost 200 000 deaths per year in the EU caused by adverse reactions to prescribed drugs, I welcome the new EU-wide system to monitor the safety of medicines which have already been approved for use by doctors. Adverse reactions are the fifth most common cause of hospital death in Europe. This legislation will set out rules and procedures for monitoring the safety profile of medicinal products once they have been authorised and placed on the market. The new powers will also equip national and EU authorities to target the growing problem of forged or falsified medicines, which pose an enormous threat to public health. The more up-to-date information available to the healthcare sector and to individual patients on the safety of medicines in common use, the better it is for the health and safety of all European citizens. I therefore welcome the European medicines web portal, which will be created and linked to national medicines web portals in each Member State, and where patients will be able to find information about the safety of the medicine they are taking.","Mr President, I congratulate my colleague, Linda McAvan, on her report.

It is also a country in which sales of this type of appliance are rising year by year. The development of technology and the growth in demand for goods of this type are also causing an increase in the quantities of what is known as e-waste, and there is a problem with processing this waste and with the effect of this process on environmental pollution. Therefore, the new provisions of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive are extremely important for the producers of this type of appliance. They are required to eliminate harmful substances and to raise safety standards for appliances which are intended for everyday use. This is also good news for consumers, because the new rules introduce the obligation to use substances which are safe for health and the environment, and this applies to all producers of electrical appliances throughout the European Union.","Poland is one of the largest producers of television, radio and domestic electrical appliances in Europe.

Zigmantas Balčytis ,S&D," I voted for this proposal to review Rule 70 of the Rules of Procedure on interinstitutional negotiations in legislative procedures with a view to making the procedures more effective, more transparent and more comprehensive. The proposal seeks to incorporate some key elements of the Code of conduct for negotiating in the context of the ordinary legislative procedures in the binding part of the Rules, and in particular those parts relating to entry of a committee into negotiation as well as negotiating team composition and mandate. The introduction of binding rules for negotiations in legislative procedures would increase accountability and thus would strengthen representative democracy in the EU. I agree with the proposals regarding the introduction of a procedure which ensures transparency and legitimacy of all decisions on the opening of negotiations at first reading. Moreover, an ‘emergency brake’ procedure should be created which could result in a simple vote on the question of opening negotiations.","I voted for this proposal to review Rule 70 of the Rules of Procedure on interinstitutional negotiations in legislative procedures with a view to making the procedures more effective, more transparent and more comprehensive.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Thank you very much for your question and for the very clearly expressed ambition, but I think we have to be realistic on the ambitious targets that we set. There’s nothing wrong with being realistic, because, looking back, we have failed to implement the targets before. And every time we return, we return with new targets. And of course, I’m happy to do so. But I think there is a clock ticking and asking for urgent implementation. So I think the 30x30 target which is proposed, which is there, is enough. Because if you look back at the Aichi targets, they are still relevant and they are not implemented. Secondly, what we have to have, in order to successfully implement it, is a monitoring framework review clause, which would allow us a successful implementation. Last but not least, when we speak about the Paris moment for biodiversity and the environment, what we want to do with the COP, and when you mentioned at the beginning that the rounds in Geneva and Nairobi didn’t bring the result that we expected, you’re absolutely right. I think there are many reasons for that. But one of the key reasons was, of course, that COP15 was constantly postponed and, of course, it didn’t get the political momentum that it should have. So hopefully now, when we have clarity, that will pick up pace. I think if you compare the Nairobi round and the Geneva round, there was already progress. Yes, that progress is still in brackets. And we will have to do a lot of work to take it from brackets and make it an agreement, because we have to be also, you know, very clear here that there is no broad agreement between countries, and that will require a huge effort negotiating even 30x30 targets, and then, at the end of the day, it’s implementation. But I am optimistic. I think the EU has the credibility to talk and to lead.

On account of their age and gender, women are in a more vulnerable situation and struggle to find a job. They are much more likely to work on a casual or part-time basis and to be isolated. This report advocates equality between men and women, particularly with regard to salary and pension calculations. It emphasises the need to cater for women over 50 in European policies. It makes many relevant proposals such as extending parental leave to people who care for their parents, and establishing training policies aimed at older women.

Ce jargon est indigne car la réalité, c’est que des êtres humains se noient chaque jour et que l’Europe ne fait rien! Il est temps que cela change!","– Madame la Présidente, Monsieur le Commissaire, chers collègues, à Lampedusa, avec le docteur Pietro Bartolo, qui est à côté de moi, j’ai vu la mort dans le regard tétanisé des exilés tout juste sauvés. À Grande-Synthe, dans ma ville, parmi les milliers de Kurdes que j'ai accueillis, j'ai entendu la détresse de Mustapha, syrien, me racontant comment les passeurs jetaient par-dessus bord des passagers pétris de peur. À Tarifa, j’ai ressenti la terreur lorsque nous avons voulu traversé le détroit",nan
Maria Arena,S&D," – Monsieur le Président, Madame la Commissaire, c’est vrai, le Bangladesh, on l’a dit, est l’atelier de couture du monde. Le prêt-à-porter représente 84 % de ses exportations, principalement vers l’Union européenne. Le Rana Plaza a montré au monde entier les dessous de ce qu’on appelle la fast fashion qui, dans l’irrespect des droits sociaux et environnementaux, a bâti une forme d’esclavage moderne. Aujourd’hui, le salaire minimal des femmes dans ces entreprises est de 67 dollars par mois, alors que le besoin d’un ménage pour vivre au Bangladesh est de 360 euros par mois – on voit à quel point l’écart existe. Ces entreprises multinationales, comme H&M, C&A ou Primark, continuent dans l’irresponsabilité quand elles décident de ne pas payer des commandes parce qu’elles ne pouvaient pas les écouler pendant le COVID. Alors oui, il faut contraindre ces entreprises. Il faut, bien entendu, des lois qui permettent ici, au niveau de l’Union européenne, de garantir une chaîne de valeur qui soit respectueuse des droits sociaux et environnementaux. Madame la Commissaire, les inciter ne sert à rien. Cela permet d’avoir effectivement certains avantages, certaines garanties, mais ça ne permet pas de changer ce modèle. Parce que le modèle qu’elles emploient, c’est de vendre toujours plus, toujours moins cher, et c’est cela qu’elles feront si elles ne sont pas contraintes de faire autrement. Il est de notre responsabilité de les contraindre.","– Monsieur le Président, Madame la Commissaire, c’est vrai, le Bangladesh, on l’a dit, est l’atelier de couture du monde.

Jérémy Decerle,N/A,"rapporteur. – Madame la Présidente, Madame la Commissaire, le rapport qui est présenté aujourd’hui devant notre assemblée sur le bien-être des animaux à la ferme est un rapport d’évaluation. Il vise à aider notre institution à formuler des propositions pour l’évolution de la réglementation européenne existante. Il ne se veut rien de plus et rien de moins.  Le bien-être des animaux est un sujet sensible. Certains préféreraient fermer les yeux sur cette préoccupation sociétale grandissante et éviter d’en parler. Ils voudraient que nous ne fassions rien du tout, sans même chercher à comprendre l’enjeu. D’autres, au contraire, qui en font leur combat, dénoncent ce qu’ils considèrent comme un manque d’action, promeuvent de nouvelles pratiques – souvent inadaptées –, réclament la suppression d’autres, quand ce n’est pas tout simplement la suppression de l’élevage. Ils attendent beaucoup de nous, nous observent et nous notent, même, parfois.  Nous ne sommes ni dans un camp ni dans l’autre. Nous sommes, pour la très grande majorité de ce Parlement, ceux qui font, ceux qui agissent, ceux dont la responsabilité est de proposer des moyens d’avancer ; car c’est bien là la question qui est devant nous: non pas de savoir à quel niveau de priorité nous plaçons le sujet du bien-être animal, ni si nous devons progresser ou pas, car, évidemment, il le faut toujours, mais plutôt – et c’est plus difficile – celle de savoir comment nous progressons.  Je tiens à remercier très sincèrement les rapporteurs des autres groupes, avec qui j’ai eu le plaisir de travailler, pour leur engagement et leur posture très majoritairement constructive. Nous sommes, je crois, parvenus à présenter un travail utile, que le Parlement adoptera, j’espère, et qui viendra nourrir les législations futures. Nous nous sommes appuyés sur des faits, et en premier lieu sur une étude pilotée par le Service de recherche du Parlement, une étude documentée, fondée sur des entretiens, et dont les enseignements étaient parlants. J’en ai pour ma part tiré quelques convictions, qui sont au cœur du rapport dont nous discutons aujourd’hui, lequel a été largement soutenu par la commission de l’agriculture et enrichi, bien sûr, de contributions de la commission de l’environnement.  Il y a quatre points sur lesquels j’aimerais insister, car ils me semblent être le fondement de notre message. Le premier, c’est qu’il n’y aura pas de nouveaux progrès possibles en matière de bien-être animal en élevage tant que nous n’aurons pas réussi à harmoniser la mise en œuvre et les contrôles des règles qui existent déjà. Relever la barre avant d’avoir réussi cela, ce serait, je crois, se faire plaisir, mais condamner toute efficacité tout en mettant à mal notre marché commun. Renforçons nos moyens de surveillance. Accompagnons les États membres et les acteurs économiques d’abord. Étendons le champ des espèces couvertes par la réglementation; beaucoup méritent des règles spécifiques et adaptées. Ensuite, nous pourrons revoir nos ambitions à la hausse.  Le deuxième point, c’est que nous ne parviendrons à rien en cherchant à agir contre les éleveurs, qui sont, que certains le veuillent ou non, les premiers acteurs du sujet, des acteurs qu’il faut encourager à continuer à bien s’occuper de leurs bêtes, ce que la plupart font déjà. C’est ce qu’il faudra commencer par reconnaître, justement, en rémunérant ces efforts, y compris quand ils vont au-delà de la réglementation.  Le troisième point, qui est lié, c’est que nous avons besoin, pour cette reconnaissance et cette rémunération, d’un étiquetage moins anarchique qu’aujourd’hui, plus encadré, qui s’appuie sur des cahiers des charges sérieux, mais qui laisse la place à des initiatives privées, d’États membres, de filières, d’ONG ou d’acteurs réunis. Pourquoi ne pas envisager un socle commun obligatoire et poser des garde-fous pour éviter les dérives et les demandes farfelues? Les consommateurs veulent de la lisibilité, certes, mais pas une approche trop normative.  Le quatrième et dernier point, c’est que le continent, qui a déjà choisi aujourd’hui, à juste titre, de se doter des standards les plus exigeants du monde, ne pourra continuer à les relever que s’il est capable de les faire respecter aussi par les produits importés. Sinon, encore une fois, nous pourrons nous targuer d’être exigeants, mais nos consommateurs n’en profiteront pas, et nous n’aurons fait qu’exporter le problème.  En responsabilité, je suis convaincu que nous devons intégrer ces principes si nous voulons vraiment avancer. Continuer à améliorer le bien-être des animaux est mon souhait, n’en doutez pas. C’est le souhait d’un nombre croissant de citoyens. C’est le souhait de la grande majorité des éleveurs et de cent pour cent de celles et ceux qui s’installent en élevage aujourd’hui. Nous n’atteindrons cette ambition que si nous appliquons ces principes d’harmonisation, de reconnaissance, de juste valorisation et de réciprocité.","rapporteur. – Madame la Présidente, Madame la Commissaire, le rapport qui est présenté aujourd’hui devant notre assemblée sur le bien-être des animaux à la ferme est un rapport d’évaluation.

José Manuel Barroso,N/A," Mr Portas, thank you for your question. It is true that getting Parliament to agree to approve a specific budget for some of the actions relating to energy efficiency, energy security and the fight against climate change proved extremely difficult, and I am very happy that this has been achieved. I would like to thank all those who made the approval of this budget possible. If, as I hope, we come to an agreement in Copenhagen, we will then have to work to find the funds necessary to implement that agreement within the budget. We are not quite there yet, but I am absolutely certain that if the Member States come to an agreement on future funding for mitigation actions needed for developing countries, then they will also have to come to an agreement on the funds that will have to be made available to meet this objective.","Mr Portas, thank you for your question.

El Parlamento Europeo, con quince Estados miembros, ha decidido unirse a la demanda de la Comisión ante el Tribunal de Justicia de la Unión Europea para que se declare la ilegalidad de esta ley de acuerdo con el Derecho europeo por contradecir el Derecho europeo.

James Nicholson,ECR,"Mr President, I welcome the final agreement on the Batteries Directive, although I would have preferred a longer transition date for the cadmium exemption. The compromise of 31 December 2016 is acceptable when viewed in the light of the additional agreement which states that existing stocks already placed on the market can be sold until all stocks are exhausted. This is particularly important for small SMEs, which would already be adversely affected by the draconian removal of cadmium accumulators.  The decision to ban mercury button cells is a further step towards reaching the targets of the UN Minamata Convention on banning most uses of mercury by 2020.

The compromise of 31 December 2016 is acceptable when viewed in the light of the additional agreement which states that existing stocks already placed on the market can be sold until all stocks are exhausted. This is particularly important for small SMEs, which would already be adversely affected by the draconian removal of cadmium accumulators.

Ilda Figueiredo ,GUE/NGL," Mr President, we have been extremely concerned to witness all the developments surrounding the reform of the budget, particularly in relation to the structural and cohesion policy. In a crisis marked by huge social inequalities and regional asymmetries, the structural and cohesion policy is a basic factor for effective economic and social cohesion. That means maintaining tight objectives in this area and not attempting to nationalise the costs of Community policies in either agriculture or fisheries, which would harm less developed countries and regions as well as outermost regions. There are various signs, however, that moves are afoot to subvert the cohesion concept even further, either by trying to make it include and finance all kinds of actions and actors that have no connection with cohesion objectives – especially the European Union’s strategy for 2020 and climate change policy – or by changing eligibility and management criteria. This debate on the cohesion policy after 2013 is therefore much needed. We look forward to obtaining clear responses in support of a genuine economic and social cohesion policy.","Mr President, we have been extremely concerned to witness all the developments surrounding the reform of the budget, particularly in relation to the structural and cohesion policy.

Anže Logar,N/A," President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, dear Commissioner, honourable Members, thank you for the opportunity to discuss here in the plenary the so-called Pandora Papers.  Revelations of this kind are not new, and have in fact regularly appeared in the media in the past few years. The most recent data gathered in the context of the Pandora Papers should be the subject of further analysis by all the institutions concerned, in particular Member States, to find out whether illegal operations have indeed taken place.  Of course, it is not up to the Council to pronounce itself on any specific case mentioned in the most recent revelation. But this revelation shows once more how important the ongoing efforts in the area of fighting tax fraud and evasion remain. The EU will continue to strongly support work in this field.  Since the Council has started working on this issue, we have reached quite some progress in the area of fighting evasive practices over the last few years, be it in the area of money laundering or in the field of taxation. Regarding anti-money laundering. On financial secrecy, a lot of progress has been made on enhancing financial transparency through the successive anti—money laundering directives. One of the aspects that merits highlighting in the introduction of the Member States of publicly available register for companies, trusts and other legal arrangements, which has already yielded some results. In this context, I would also like to mention the anti-money laundering package that the Council has received over the summer. One of the aims of the package is to close loopholes used by criminals to launder illicit proceeds through the financial systems. The article by article examination of the proposal is ongoing in the competent working parties, and even through this will require thorough discussion. The Council is determined to move towards a mandate for negotiation with the Parliament in a swift manner. Regarding tax transparency. In the area of taxation there has been significant progress on transparency. Thanks to the various directives in the field of administrative cooperation, the so-called DAC Directive, Member States have the tools to exchange a wide array of data relating to taxation.  Thanks to DAC 6 on cross-border aggressive tax planning, for instance, intermediaries are now under an obligation to report dubious schemes to tax authorities. Administrative cooperation is regarded as a priority in the fight against aggressive tax planning worldwide. Exchange of information is essential between Member States as well as with third countries.  The two anti-tax avoidance directives have also given an impetus to make the use of shell companies less attractive by introducing rules and controlled foreign companies and hybrid mismatches, just to name a few aspects.  In this context, I think that the forthcoming legislative proposal targeted to the use of shell companies will be particularly relevant, and we are looking forward to receiving it from the Commission as soon as possible.  The EU is also contributing in the move towards more transparency through the significant global influence of the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes. Since 2017, through a cooperative approach coupled with the necessary deterrence, the EU has been able to convince a large number of third countries to become more transparent and limit the effect of their taxation regime on other countries.  Of course, the work is not finished and the Code of Conduct Group will continue to engage with dozens of third countries to improve tax transparency, also in coordination with the OECD. Focusing more specifically on the fight against tax avoidance, one of the work strands in the OECD discussions on digital taxation is a global minimum effective tax rate – the so-called globe, which could reshape global taxation arrangement in a fundamental way.  In its conclusions of November last year, the Council spoke out in favour of a global deal, and I sincerely hope that the statement that is being negotiated will garner as much support as possible at the OECD and G20 so that an agreement can be implemented globally in the coming years.  Thank you very much for giving me the possibility to share and to listen today’s discussion, and to explain the Council’s point of view and lines of action in this extremely topical subject.","President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, dear Commissioner, honourable Members, thank you for the opportunity to discuss here in the plenary the so-called Pandora Papers.

Patrick O'Flynn ,ID,"Mr President, let me start with some common ground. Clearly, if your project for European integration is to recover – mercifully, without the United Kingdom – it will require an enhanced level of social solidarity between the peoples of Europe. So it is not surprising that integrationists should set such store by top—down projects designed to tell the citizens of Europe’s nation states that their prime collective identity should be a continental one rather than a national one. When, for example, German citizens are next told that Greek citizens need another euro bailout, federalists will wish their first reaction to be, ‘Yes, we Europeans must stand together’ and not ‘Why should more German money go to Greece?’ But I am afraid that you might as well push water uphill as try to indoctrinate people about the collective loyalties that they feel. In no other continent on earth are so many distinct cultures, countries and languages held in such close proximity. That is what makes Europe the most interesting continent. People like Mr Verhofstadt think Europe is a continent of dwarves that cannot compete in the modern world and that we need to bring every aspect of public policy under the EU umbrella. But there is a better way forward and that is to be less doctrinaire and less rigid, to get behind NATO as our key defensive alliance, to allow nation states to return to national currencies that reflect their economic conditions, to trust that the peoples of a democratic Europe will be too sensible to return to the days of ultra-nationalism that caused the shedding of so much blood. But to try and force a European identity through top—down programmes such as Europe for Citizens is self—defeating.

Rui Tavares ,GUE/NGL," Mr Barroso, there is no point in making speeches about the state of the Union if, at a time when one of the fundamental principles of the Union is under attack, the President of the Commission’s response is tepid, timid and weak. Mr Barroso, your first reference to what is happening to the Roma in France was more or less adequate; your second was, frankly, an embarrassment for the Commission. That is because what started with the Roma is already moving on to the poor: President Sarkozy said yesterday that Europeans without means of supporting themselves in France could not stay there more than three months. That means that, not only will this leave us on the brink of destroying the principle of freedom of movement, which is fundamental to the EU, but also that we will now be more vulnerable to the crisis, because, as we know very well, workforce mobility is one way in which countries respond to the crisis. In the United States, if the automotive industry fails in Detroit, people go to Chicago; they will not be able to do this in Europe. If the Commission talks clearly about this now, it will be doing Europe a great service by standing up to the destruction of fundamental principles of the Union that is occurring.

Kajti predvsem ta vidik, ki je vezan na sociološke kriterije, lahko zaplete te postopke, lahko jih zaplete zaradi tega, ker tukaj ni eksaktnih meril. Sicer je to lepo, je zelo ljudsko, bi to sicer zelo podpirala, ampak ker vem, kaj pomenijo postopki javnega naročanja, lahko pride ravno tukaj do problematike. In zaradi tega in zaradi nove zakonodaje, ki ima mnogo več plusov kot minusov, verjamem, da bo več malih in srednjih podjetij imelo delo in da bodo ljudje imeli delovna mesta.","Javno naročilo po najnižji ceni pomeni tudi tunel, ki nima informacijske infrastrukture in ne moremo slišati radia, ko smo v tunelu.

Marek Henryk Migalski ,ECR," Madam President, as Mrs McClarkin has said, our political group will support this scheme, because it is a good one, and it should be endorsed when the vote is taken. I am pleased that during work on the scheme it was possible to eliminate several features which were a cause for concern. Amongst other things, protection of personal data has been increased and the minimum age for supporting an initiative has been raised from 16 to 18 years. This is a good result. However, I do have several critical remarks. Firstly, as my colleague Mrs McClarkin has said, it is, in fact, the Commission which is going to decide whether or not an initiative is accepted, and so the voice of the people is still going to be dependent on officials, even if they are acting in good faith. Another matter is that it should be considered whether the 300 000 votes needed for an initiative and the one quarter of the Member States which have to be represented is not too low a threshold. In Poland, an initiative of this kind requires the signatures of 100 000 people. On the much larger scale of the entire European Union – Poles constitute only 8% of the population – I think this is questionable. However, in spite of these doubts, the scheme is worth supporting and the European Conservatives and Reformists will certainly endorse it.","Madam President, as Mrs McClarkin has said, our political group will support this scheme, because it is a good one, and it should be endorsed when the vote is taken.

Adam Bielan,ECR," Madam President, the eyes of the whole world were on Yemen recently, after al-Qaeda activists there claimed responsibility for what was, fortunately, an unsuccessful attempt to blow up an American airliner at Christmas. However, we have known for a long time that the deteriorating state of security in the country is allowing terrorist groups to find refuge from where they can plan and organise further operations. Terrorism had been spreading in the region for many years before 9/11, a day we all remember. We need only recall the al-Qaeda attack on the American warship, the USS Cole, on 12 October 2000. Yemen is an extremely significant country, in particular, because of its geographical location. We must remember that 3.5 million barrels of crude oil, which is 4% of world production, are transported every day through the 26.5-kilometre Bab-el-Mandeb Strait between Yemen and Djibouti. At the same time, it is a country with a very complicated internal situation. Apart from al-Qaeda, which is thriving there, there is also a serious Shi’ite rebellion in Saada Province in the north of the country and an outbreak of violence from secessionist movements in the south. If we add to this the negative effects of the world food crisis of two years ago, the recent financial crisis, the country’s dwindling reserves of crude oil, which account for three-quarters of its income, and finally an increasingly serious water shortage, we have a picture of a country on its knees, the ideal target for al-Qaeda, which, in view of its problems in Afghanistan, is looking for a new base. Therefore, apart from military action which, in one form or another, would appear to be unavoidable in view of the passivity and helplessness of the local authorities, the international community, including the European Union – and here I appeal to Mrs Ashton – must, above all, be very active in the process of rebuilding state institutions.","Madam President, the eyes of the whole world were on Yemen recently, after al-Qaeda activists there claimed responsibility for what was, fortunately, an unsuccessful attempt to blow up an American airliner at Christmas.

While, on the one hand, it is true that businesses – irrespective of their size – need to draw up accounts for tax and statistical purposes, to assess various aspects of their operations and to make it easier to deal with banks, it is also true that the complexity of some accounting rules is a cost, in terms of time and money, that has a greater effect on micro-entities than big businesses.

Jean-Luc Bennahmias ,ALDE," Providing access to food for all, against a backdrop of rising global demand and food shortages for several billion people across the world, is a huge and essential challenge. In the European Union alone, 16% of people live below the poverty line and struggle to have their most basic needs – housing, health and, of course, food – met. It is with this in mind that, in order to fuel debate, we voted for a resolution recognising agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security. At a time when we are considering the future of the CAP, it seems necessary not to overlook this need and this right – which should be universal – to food for all. One of our aims is to combat speculation in the agricultural sector: we call for a review of the legislation on financial instruments. We need less price volatility and more transparency. We also propose the idea of a ‘targeted global system of food stocks’ in order to manage crises more effectively, and we invite the Commission to give thought to this type of measure.","Providing access to food for all, against a backdrop of rising global demand and food shortages for several billion people across the world, is a huge and essential challenge.

Paolo Gentiloni,N/A," Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am very pleased to be here to discuss the adoption prospects for Croatia. This is an historical step for this country – a country that 30 years ago was at war. And I think we see the progress that was made with the EU candidates who are entering the EU and now the prospects of joining the euro. The Parliament is playing its full part in the enlargement procedure. And I want to thank all of you and the rapporteur, the honourable Mr Mureşan.  On 1 June, as you remembered, the Commission concluded its convergence report that Croatia has achieved the high degree of sustainable economic convergence with the euro area economy and is ready to adopt the euro on 1 January next year.  The ECB report was fully aligned with ours. Croatia has fulfilled the four economic convergence criteria, and its national legislation on monetary affairs is also in line with the Treaty. The Commission has therefore made the legal proposal, required by the Treaty, for the introduction of the single currency. We have examined Croatia thoroughly and fairly in full respect of the principle of equal treatment. The conditions for Croatia to thrive in the euro area are clearly in place. Following our proposal, euro area member countries in the Council adopted the recommendation supporting Croatia’s adoption of the euro. The European Council agreed that Croatia fulfils the convergence criteria of the Treaty and is ready to adopt the single currency.  Now I invite the European Parliament to signal its political support for the euro adoption by Croatia on 1 January 2023. Following the vote of the European Parliament, the Council will be able to adopt the final legislative proposal on 12 July. And this would give sufficient time for Croatia to prepare for the 1 January changeover. Above all, this would be a message of trust and determination – the strong signal that European monetary integration is a successful project. It will be a reminder that sustained policy efforts generate concrete results.  Joining the euro area will contribute to increase Croatia’s potential growth and to strengthen the adjustment capacity of its economy. To this end, the effective implementation of Croatia’s recovery and resilience plan will be key. As you know, based on the fulfilment of first milestones and targets, the Commission made a first payment of EUR 700 million to Croatia last week and we look forward to more reforms and investment.  So, as the honourable Mr Mureşan said, it is a starting point, but a starting point of historical importance for Croatia.","Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am very pleased to be here to discuss the adoption prospects for Croatia.

The Danish Presidency is also going to tackle the budget for 2014-2020. So it is extremely important that it maintain the very important Cohesion Fund, thanks to which the Union’s new Member States from Central and Eastern Europe can develop.

Valdemar Tomaševski ,ECR," The rights of European Union citizens comply with the highest standards in terms of protecting people from abuses of power. There is great emphasis on the principle of justice as the foundation of communication between the state and citizens. There are still European Union Member States that do not respect this principle and justice has nothing to do with equality of all before the law. This includes disregard for property rights, particularly property rights to plots of land in Lithuania, where land that was seized in the Soviet period is in the process of being re-privatised. Very often, land is not returned to its rightful owners despite documents confirming their right to the property. Plots of land are going to people who, until now, had never owned them. This leads to misuse of finances and corruption and, most importantly, violates the sacrosanct right to property. The state is thus applying laws to citizens inconsistently and is selectively violating human rights. Another example concerns the infamous paedophile scandal in Lithuania, involving high-ranking justice officials, including judges. The court, the police and bailiffs are doing everything they can to remove a child, who is also the victim and principal witness of this event, from her custodian. Everything is happening in an atmosphere of fear with the public authorities making a show of force. It seems that the aim of all of this is to intimidate witnesses rather than dismantle an organised paedophile ring. This is an example of a violation of citizens’ rights showing that in such situations, some are more equal than others. Citizens’ rights must be equal for all, regardless of a person’s place of residence or social status.","The rights of European Union citizens comply with the highest standards in terms of protecting people from abuses of power.

Federica Mogherini,N/A,"Mr President, sometimes listening to some of the comments, let me be very frank, we had doubts and thought that maybe a careful reading of the proposal itself could be useful, to start from the facts.  In the debates this afternoon you mixed many different things. Mr Verhofstadt was asking at the beginning – it is a pity he is not here – whether this is a duplication of the deal with Turkey. The two situations are completely different. As Frans mentioned at the beginning, from Turkey we have mainly Syrian refugees. It is temporary – hopefully temporary, we are working also on that, this is another story – a flow of refugees, asylum seekers. That falls into one specific international legal framework. We are trying to deal with that in a sort of immediate and also – let me use this word that I do not like at all, but that is the reality of our policies today – emergency mode.  What we are putting on the table here is something completely different. It is something that starts from the fact that with Africa we have a common interest in working on the development of the continent with a sense of partnership.  Some of you asked how are the African interlocutors reacting to this? Very well. Yesterday I was in New York at the Security Council. African countries, but not only African countries, Latin American countries, were saying: This is the right way to go because finally you are not only investing in development – which is the right thing to do, by the way, in itself. And incidentally, I am proud to say that the European Union is the first donor worldwide, it is the first – and if you want, I can give you the figures for it also being the first donor to Africa – the first donor internationally with more than half of the official development assistance worldwide: EUR 68 billion in 2015, over EUR 20 billion ODA to Africa every year, and this is going to stay. I am proud of that.  This is the right thing to do anyway but there is another issue. Please go to Ethiopia and talk to the women that came back voluntarily, not from Europe but from the Gulf because they were becoming slaves, while we support projects from the ILO to reintegrate them into their communities, offering training and job opportunities. Listen to their stories and then come back to me and say that we are doing deals on their shoulders. No. We are protecting their lives and their rights. Go and talk with the young girls from Nigeria who turn into sex slaves in Europe and tell me that the deal we want to strike with Nigeria is not to protect their rights and their lives.  I am sorry, but you do not protect the lives of people only by saving them at sea. You also save their lives at the beginning of the journey. Go to Lampedusa and listen to the stories that the survivors tell you, or if you cannot fly there, watch the movie ‘Fuocoammare’ (Fire at Sea). There was a showing of it a couple of months ago in the European Parliament in Brussels. Listen to those words that tell you that these people are turned into slaves from the very beginning of their journeys. They are in chains crossing the deserts, locked in jails in Libya, locked in the boats that then sink.  We have a human responsibility – and our African partners as well have a human responsibility – to protect their lives. This is what we are talking about, and doing this together with international agencies starting from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the UNHCR.  So what we are talking about is job creation, perfectly rightly, for African women, for African youth – go to Agadez, that was living from tourism before security made it impossible – about offering those young people job opportunities that are not linked to the smuggling networks or the criminal organisations, working on education, working on social development, working also on human rights and protection of the people. This is what we are talking about.  So, is it enough? No. But sorry, if we never start to do the right thing, in 10 years’ time the people who come after us will be facing exactly the same thing and I wish the people that were here 10 years ago had made the same choices as we are proposing to you today, because maybe today we would have better situations in Africa and also in Europe. We have to start somewhere.  So we know very well this this proposal is not going to turn the situation upside down in 24 hours, but there is no policy that could do that, and we should stop selling illusions to our people. But there are good things we can start doing consistently in partnership to change things, and we have to start.  So this is what we are proposing today. This goes together with opening regular channels for migration, for sure, this also is not my direct responsibility. This is also linked to the need for Member States to be coherent and do their part. This is also about other actors in the world doing their part and being coherent, from Asia to Latin America, to North America and the international organisations, to the UN system and to our African partners, because the only thing that would change Africa is not only our compacts, it is African leadership.  And here, believe me, we are very straightforward, very much so, because there is no other way of changing African societies other than yes, investing, but also creating, together with investments, the conditions for investments to flourish which are: the rule of law, interconnection within the continent – if you want to fly or to travel from one African capital to another you have to fly to Europe; does that make sense? – developing infrastructures, developing security conditions that are good for European investments, that are good for African investors as well, and people. So yes, it can be win-win-win.  Last, but not least, some of you mentioned the fact that, as the flows diminish or go down to zero on the eastern route, we see an increase on the central Mediterranean route. Let me tell you, please have a look at the numbers but most of all at the nationalities. They are two completely different routes and there is no link, as of today. Last year, through Libya to Sicily, we were facing a major inflow of Syrians. It is not the case today. At the moment we are not seeing a shift. It is simply that Africa is young, it is poor, it is facing the dramatic effect of climate change, and it is only natural that this happens, if we do not work with a long-term strategic perspective to change this. That is what we are suggesting to you to do.","Mr President, sometimes listening to some of the comments, let me be very frank, we had doubts and thought that maybe a careful reading of the proposal itself could be useful, to start from the facts. In the debates this afternoon you mixed many different things. Mr Verhofstadt was asking at the beginning – it is a pity he is not here – whether this is a duplication of the deal with Turkey. The two situations are completely different. As Frans mentioned at the beginning, from Turkey we have mainly Syrian refugees. It is temporary – hopefully temporary, we are working also on that, this is another story – a flow of refugees, asylum seekers. That falls into one specific international legal framework. We are trying to deal with that in a sort of immediate and also – let me use this word that I do not like at all, but that is the reality of our policies today – emergency mode. What we are putting on the table here is something completely different. It is something that starts from the fact that with Africa we have a common interest in working on the development of the continent with a sense of partnership. Some of you asked how are the African interlocutors reacting to this? Very well. Yesterday I was in New York at the Security Council. African countries, but not only African countries, Latin American countries, were saying: This is the right way to go because finally you are not only investing in development – which is the right thing to do, by the way, in itself. And incidentally, I am proud to say that the European Union is the first donor worldwide, it is the first – and if you want, I can give you the figures for it also being the first donor to Africa – the first donor internationally with more than half of the official development assistance worldwide: EUR 68 billion in 2015, over EUR 20 billion ODA to Africa every year, and this is going to stay. I am proud of that. This is the right thing to do anyway but there is another issue. Please go to Ethiopia and talk to the women that came back voluntarily, not from Europe but from the Gulf because they were becoming slaves, while we support projects from the ILO to reintegrate them into their communities, offering training and job opportunities. Listen to their stories and then come back to me and say that we are doing deals on their shoulders. No. We are protecting their lives and their rights. Go and talk with the young girls from Nigeria who turn into sex slaves in Europe and tell me that the deal we want to strike with Nigeria is not to protect their rights and their lives. I am sorry, but you do not protect the lives of people only by saving them at sea. You also save their lives at the beginning of the journey. Go to Lampedusa and listen to the stories that the survivors tell you, or if you cannot fly there, watch the movie ‘Fuocoammare’ . There was a showing of it a couple of months ago in the European Parliament in Brussels. Listen to those words that tell you that these people are turned into slaves from the very beginning of their journeys. They are in chains crossing the deserts, locked in jails in Libya, locked in the boats that then sink. We have a human responsibility – and our African partners as well have a human responsibility – to protect their lives. This is what we are talking about, and doing this together with international agencies starting from the International Organisation for Migration and the UNHCR. So what we are talking about is job creation, perfectly rightly, for African women, for African youth – go to Agadez, that was living from tourism before security made it impossible – about offering those young people job opportunities that are not linked to the smuggling networks or the criminal organisations, working on education, working on social development, working also on human rights and protection of the people. This is what we are talking about. So, is it enough? No. But sorry, if we never start to do the right thing, in 10 years’ time the people who come after us will be facing exactly the same thing and I wish the people that were here 10 years ago had made the same choices as we are proposing to you today, because maybe today we would have better situations in Africa and also in Europe. We have to start somewhere. So we know very well this this proposal is not going to turn the situation upside down in 24 hours, but there is no policy that could do that, and we should stop selling illusions to our people. But there are good things we can start doing consistently in partnership to change things, and we have to start. So this is what we are proposing today. This goes together with opening regular channels for migration, for sure, this also is not my direct responsibility. This is also linked to the need for Member States to be coherent and do their part. This is also about other actors in the world doing their part and being coherent, from Asia to Latin America, to North America and the international organisations, to the UN system and to our African partners, because the only thing that would change Africa is not only our compacts, it is African leadership.

Agnès Evren,PPE," – Monsieur le Président, Madame la Commissaire, je ne peux naturellement que m’associer aux prises de parole précédentes et remercier les négociateurs d’être parvenus si rapidement à un accord sur l’Année européenne de la jeunesse 2022. Les jeunes Européens sont le moteur de l’Europe de demain, mais la crise de la COVID-19 a enrayé leurs élans. Entre confinement et mesures sanitaires, certains vivent parfois l’isolement, le décrochage, voire la précarité. Cette Année européenne de la jeunesse doit donc être l’occasion de faire entendre leur voix, de les associer à nos initiatives et de guider nos actions. L’un des grands objectifs de cette année - qui m’occupe tout, particulièrement, au sein de la commission des pétitions - est la participation des jeunes au processus décisionnel de l’Union européenne. Le droit de pétition, l’initiative citoyenne européenne ou encore le droit de saisir le médiateur européen doivent être autant d’outils entre leurs mains pour leur permettre de s’engager davantage dans la vie de l’Union européenne. En tant que députés, nous avons un rôle primordial: celui d’aider les jeunes à acquérir une meilleure compréhension des diverses possibilités qui leur sont offertes, que ce soit au niveau européen, national, régional ou local.  Je pense également au programme Erasmus+, qui fêtera ses 35 ans en 2022, et qui jouera un rôle central dans la mise en œuvre et le financement des activités de cette Année européenne de la jeunesse. Alors que la présidence française de l’Union européenne débutera en janvier 2022, je serai pleinement engagée en faveur de notre jeunesse pour que cette année soit un réel succès. Les actions que nous mettrons en place ne devront d’ailleurs pas se cantonner à l’année 2022, car les jeunes sont notre priorité et notre avenir.","– Monsieur le Président, Madame la Commissaire, je ne peux naturellement que m’associer aux prises de parole précédentes et remercier les négociateurs d’être parvenus si rapidement à un accord sur l’Année européenne de la jeunesse 2022.

As the EU’s agricultural policy has been adapted to the market, these stockpiles have dwindled and the option of using EU funds to stockpile commodities has been abolished for several products.

Gabriele Zimmer,GUE/NGL," Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a fundamental conflict which is already becoming apparent in relation to the European Social Fund (ESF). The Treaty of Lisbon recommends that the ESF should focus primarily on active labour market policy. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left believe that it is necessary for the ESF to be applied more broadly in future to general social policy and, most importantly, to be used much more effectively to combat poverty and social exclusion. In future, the European Social Fund should also play an effective role throughout the entire European Union and should not concentrate solely on specific regions. However, we think that there should be a greater focus on special problems in the regions, which could be accommodated more effectively via the cofinancing rates. Financing for the European Social Fund should at least stay at its current level. It should be a minimum of 1% of the gross budget of the European Union. We believe that to be absolutely essential. I would like to highlight one other problem. The proposed increased focus on the results naturally gives rise to the question with regard to the ESF of which indicators and benchmarks will form the basis for evaluating the results and what that ultimately means in terms of preparation for the project promoters in each case. These promoters do not have reserves which would allow them to make additional payments or repayments. If the ESF is to remain in existence and play an effective role, we need to have a clear overview of this issue in advance.","Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a fundamental conflict which is already becoming apparent in relation to the European Social Fund .

Rebecca Harms,Greens/EFA,"Meine Damen und Herren! Als ich gestern versucht habe, mich auf die Debatte vorzubereiten, bin ich nochmal durch die Zeitungen durchgegangen, die ich seit einer Woche in meinem Büro aufgestapelt habe. Das mache ich immer so, wenn ich nicht mehr weiß, wie es eigentlich weitergeht – und das geht mir im Moment so –, dann sammle ich und sammle ich. Und oben auf dem Stapel dieser Zeitungen der letzten Woche lag eine deutsche Zeitung mit dem Foto, dem Porträt eines griechischen Rentners, der weinend vor einem Geldautomaten zusammengebrochen war. Und es ist für mich jedenfalls das Foto, das von dieser Woche in Erinnerung bleibt. Ich glaube, dass in diesem Foto eigentlich sowohl die Gründe eingefangen worden sind, die in Griechenland dazu geführt haben, dass 60 % mit Nein gestimmt haben. Ich glaube aber, und das ist der Irrsinn dieser Situation, dass in diesem Foto auch viele der Gründe von den Leuten eingefangen worden sind, die mit Ja gestimmt haben. Denn die Abstimmung in Griechenland war eine Abstimmung darüber, dass die Verelendung eines großen Teils der Gesellschaft – und es ist keineswegs bisher die ganze Gesellschaft – nicht mehr weitergehen kann. Die Abstimmung war aber auch eindeutig eine Abstimmung darüber, dass man Hoffnung auf Veränderung immer noch an die Europäische Union knüpft. (Beifall) Und das ist jetzt Ihre Aufgabe. Da denke ich eben auch, dass Sie in einer historischen Situation der stärkste Premier Griechenlands sind, jedenfalls in meiner eigenen Erinnerung, und dass Sie jetzt derjenige sein müssen, der Ihr Volk in eine ordentliche Reformperspektive führt. Das, was bisher nicht passiert ist und wo übrigens auch die Europäer eine Verantwortung haben. Dieses Reformprogramm der Troika macht doch das Wort Reform an sich zu etwas, wovor man nur zurückschrecken kann. (Beifall) Ich muss Ihnen jetzt sagen: Vielleicht bin ich naiv, aber ich habe eigentlich erwartet, dass Sie hierher kommen und nicht nur sagen: Schluss mit Nepotismus und Korruption, sondern ich hatte diesen naiven Wunsch, der Tsipras kommt jetzt und sagt: So werde ich das mit meinen Leuten machen. (Beifall) So wird ein gerechtes Steuersystem aussehen. So wird ein gerechtes Rentensystem aussehen. Wir wissen doch alle, dass man kleine Renten nicht weiter kürzen kann. Aber die Frage ist: Wie werden die Renten in Griechenland gerecht? So wird in Zukunft das Gesundheitssystem in Griechenland aussehen, damit wir keine Armen-Kliniken mehr brauchen. Ich glaube, das ist eigentlich auch das, womit Sie nicht nur die Griechen in eine bessere Zukunft führen können, sondern womit Sie dafür sorgen können, dass die Europäer mit Ihnen mitgehen. Und das müssen wir! Dieser Zusammenhalt, der verlorengegangen ist in den letzten fünf Jahren, kann zurückgewonnen werden, wenn Sie so mit Ihren Leuten und mit den Bürgern Europas reden. Damit meine ich eben nicht nur die Staats- und Regierungschefs oder einige derjenigen, die jetzt hier heute nicht unbedingt dazu beigetragen haben, Sie einzuladen. Sie müssen in diese direkte Debatte, und die Europäer – das hat Guy Verhofstadt gesagt – müssen aus einer falschen Politik zu der Schuldenlast heraus. Und ich bin da eben auch genau der Meinung von Guy Verhofstadt, dass da eine Lösung gefunden werden muss, die nicht nur für die Griechen gebraucht wird, sondern die für andere Krisenländer gebraucht wird. Dann ist das nämlich auch gerecht. Und dann ist das auch europäisch. (Beifall) Herr Tsipras, ich weiß, dass man leider die Zeit nicht anhalten kann. Ich wünschte mir, wir könnten das. Es ist offensichtlich so, dass alles in dieser Woche entschieden werden muss. Hören Sie auf diejenigen, die eine europäische Lösung wollen! Und denken Sie daran, weil Sie so stark an die Demokratie appellieren: Europa ist groß. Der Osten gehört dazu, der braucht auch Solidarität. Und Demokratie und Putin, das geht nicht! Ich wünsche Ihnen Glück, und ich wünsche Europa Glück! (Beifall)","Meine Damen und Herren!

Ich glaube aber, und das ist der Irrsinn dieser Situation, dass in diesem Foto auch viele der Gründe von den Leuten eingefangen worden sind, die mit Ja gestimmt haben. Denn die Abstimmung in Griechenland war eine Abstimmung darüber, dass die Verelendung eines großen Teils der Gesellschaft – und es ist keineswegs bisher die ganze Gesellschaft – nicht mehr weitergehen kann. Die Abstimmung war aber auch eindeutig eine Abstimmung darüber, dass man Hoffnung auf Veränderung immer noch an die Europäische Union knüpft. Und das ist jetzt Ihre Aufgabe. Da denke ich eben auch, dass Sie in einer historischen Situation der stärkste Premier Griechenlands sind, jedenfalls in meiner eigenen Erinnerung, und dass Sie jetzt derjenige sein müssen, der Ihr Volk in eine ordentliche Reformperspektive führt. Das, was bisher nicht passiert ist und wo übrigens auch die Europäer eine Verantwortung haben. Dieses Reformprogramm der Troika macht doch das Wort Reform an sich zu etwas, wovor man nur zurückschrecken kann. Ich muss Ihnen jetzt sagen: Vielleicht bin ich naiv, aber ich habe eigentlich erwartet, dass Sie hierher kommen und nicht nur sagen: Schluss mit Nepotismus und Korruption, sondern ich hatte diesen naiven Wunsch, der Tsipras kommt jetzt und sagt: So werde ich das mit meinen Leuten machen. So wird ein gerechtes Steuersystem aussehen. So wird ein gerechtes Rentensystem aussehen. Wir wissen doch alle, dass man kleine Renten nicht weiter kürzen kann. Aber die Frage ist: Wie werden die Renten in Griechenland gerecht? So wird in Zukunft das Gesundheitssystem in Griechenland aussehen, damit wir keine Armen-Kliniken mehr brauchen. Ich glaube, das ist eigentlich auch das, womit Sie nicht nur die Griechen in eine bessere Zukunft führen können, sondern womit Sie dafür sorgen können, dass die Europäer mit Ihnen mitgehen. Und das müssen wir! Dieser Zusammenhalt, der verlorengegangen ist in den letzten fünf Jahren, kann zurückgewonnen werden, wenn Sie so mit Ihren Leuten und mit den Bürgern Europas reden. Damit meine ich eben nicht nur die Staats- und Regierungschefs oder einige derjenigen, die jetzt hier heute nicht unbedingt dazu beigetragen haben, Sie einzuladen. Sie müssen in diese direkte Debatte, und die Europäer – das hat Guy Verhofstadt gesagt – müssen aus einer falschen Politik zu der Schuldenlast heraus. Und ich bin da eben auch genau der Meinung von Guy Verhofstadt, dass da eine Lösung gefunden werden muss, die nicht nur für die Griechen gebraucht wird, sondern die für andere Krisenländer gebraucht wird. Dann ist das nämlich auch gerecht. Und dann ist das auch europäisch. Herr Tsipras, ich weiß, dass man leider die Zeit nicht anhalten kann. Ich wünschte mir, wir könnten das. Es ist offensichtlich so, dass alles in dieser Woche entschieden werden muss. Hören Sie auf diejenigen, die eine europäische Lösung wollen! Und denken Sie daran, weil Sie so stark an die Demokratie appellieren: Europa ist groß. Der Osten gehört dazu, der braucht auch Solidarität. Und Demokratie und Putin, das geht nicht! Ich wünsche Ihnen Glück, und ich wünsche Europa Glück!","Meine Damen und Herren!

In questo fondo, a nostro parere, dovrebbero confluire tutte le risorse previste da altre misure, perché c'è il rischio di avere un quadro di finanziamenti frammentato e disorientante.

Claude Moraes ,S&D,"Mr President, it’s not just the containers and the freezing conditions mentioned by Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra: over 12 000 people are now stranded in the hotspots on the Greek islands. I visited them recently in these hotspots, and the capacity is for half those numbers: there are around 5000 places. So we have a problem.  Many have mentioned what that problem is, but it boils down to two things. One, of course, is the wider political question to the Council, which is: what are the responsibilities that Member States will take on relocation and ensuring that we quickly manage the system’s Dublin III – the asylum system – to ensure that Member States meet their responsibilities. We all know that is critical. But coming back to what the Commissioner has said in detail, he admitted to the severe overcrowding and that the situation has been difficult, but he was very detailed in his response, and this is the clear focus: that funding from the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) is now coming instead of the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) funding by the Commission. But what is the absorption of this? Can the Commissioner say more about how effective this can be in the freezing conditions that we are about to meet, because that is very important?

Philippe Lamberts,Greens/EFA,"Madame la Présidente, Monsieur Timmermans, vous parlez évidemment aujourd'hui au nom du président Juncker. Je pense que l'Union européenne et vous-même avez un problème de crédibilité, non seulement parce que, dans votre discours, j'ai reconnu mot à mot le communiqué de presse sur le programme des réunions du G7 – c'est gentil de nous l'avoir lu mais j'avais pu en prendre connaissance avant que vous nous en fassiez la lecture – mais, surtout, lorsqu'on analyse la contribution européenne au débat que vous nous avez annoncée.  Prenons le sujet du climat. Je constate que l'Union européenne, avec ses décisions récentes sur les objectifs, a décidé d'un programme moins ambitieux et moins contraignant. Pourtant, nous dirons que le sommet de Paris doit être un succès. Toujours dans le domaine de l'environnement, j'observe qu'il sera question de pollution marine, en particulier par les plastiques. Or, je constate que, lorsque ce Parlement a adopté un règlement sur l'élimination – espérons-le – des sacs plastiques, c'est votre Commission qui, par votre bouche, a émis des objections à notre volonté de montrer plus d'ambition que la Commission dans sa proposition.  Passons à la question du développement. Si cela est vrai, la Commission a exprimé des réserves d'ordre juridique quant à la décision du Parlement et du Conseil de se montrer plus ambitieux que la Commission dans sa proposition. Si on examine l'aide au développement, on se rend compte que l'Union européenne non seulement ne satisfait pas à l'objectif de 0,7 % d'aide directe au développement mais mène des politiques, en particulier dans le domaine commercial, qui s'abstiennent naturellement de rendre contraignant le respect, par exemple, de normes internationalement reconnues, telles que les normes de l'OIT, comme une condition d'accès au marché européen. Vous nous dites que vous voulez imposer, que vous voulez discutez le respect de normes sociales et environnementales tout au long de la chaîne de production, mais lorsqu'on veut imposer des contraintes comme dans le cas des minerais extraits dans des zones de conflit, on voit toutes les résistances que cela suscite. On peut parler du virus Ebola et des problèmes sanitaires mondiaux. Que constate-t-on à l'occasion de la crise de l'Ebola? On constate que les contributions de l'Europe à l'OMS sont riquiqui, qu'elles sont très en deçà de ce que l'Union européenne, continent riche, devrait pouvoir faire en matière de santé au niveau mondial.  Je pourrais parler d'un sujet qui n'est pas à l'ordre du jour, ce qui est d'autant plus inquiétant, il s'agit de la régulation financière. Cela a été évoqué. On disait: ""plus jamais ça"". Or, aujourd'hui, toute une série d'indicateurs nous montre que nous sommes revenus à des niveaux de tension sur les marchés financiers, à des niveaux d'inflation, à des bulles, notamment sur les marchés d'actions ou sur les marchés immobiliers, semblables à ce qu'on a observé en 2007. Maintenant, ce n'est plus un sujet de discussion. On a rejeté hier une timide tentative européenne de scinder les banques de détail et les banques d'affaires, question dont on ne doit pas parler. Chaque continent, arguant que le continent voisin ne prend pas des mesures aussi strictes, conclut ainsi qu'on ne peut pas pénaliser la compétitivité de ses banques et qu'on ne peut bien évidemment pas lui imposer des règles que les autres n'adoptent pas. J'ai écouté le discours de Ban Ki-moon et j'ai entendu deux mots à plusieurs reprises: leadership et ambition. Je suis désolé mais, aujourd'hui, quand je vois les positions adoptées par l'Union européenne – ce n'est pas seulement la Commission, ce sont bien sûr aussi les États membres – je constate que, de plus en plus, nous manquons d'ambition et de leadership en Europe. Je voudrais terminer – il me reste trente secondes et je suis désolé que Manfred Weber ne soit plus là. J'ai entendu dans sa bouche les mots ""Gewalt geht nicht"" [la violence, ça ne va pas] – et je suis d'accord avec lui. Parmi les conquêtes de l'Union européenne figure la résolution des conflits de manière pacifique, y compris entre nous. Mais lorsque des millions de jeunes se retrouvent condamnés au chômage de manière durable, lorsque des travailleurs britanniques sont exclus des statistiques du chômage parce qu'ils ont des contrats de travail de zéro heure, et pire encore, lorsque des citoyennes et des citoyens grecs – trois millions d'entre eux – sont confrontés à la perte de la couverture maladie et invalidité ou de l'assurance santé qui condamne à mort certains d'entre eux, notamment les malades atteints du cancer ou du sida, je constate que cela est aussi de la violence.

Rachida Dati ,PPE," Mr President, I would like to continue with the argument from my speech yesterday on the preparations for the Copenhagen summit, and then mention yesterday’s Ecofin meeting, which was not hugely successful. I was questioning you on the responsibility we have as industrialised countries to behave in such a way that developing countries can follow us in our efforts to combat climate change. At Copenhagen, we cannot act as if we all have the same capabilities – this would mean that we were all starting from the same place, to arrive nowhere in the end. Therefore, to convince our partners in development to join us, we must obviously address the question of the aid they should be given and not wait for the results of the Copenhagen Summit. At the next European Council and in the important context of climate change, the 27 absolutely must agree on the way the European Union thinks about aid to developing countries. Yesterday, as I said, the Ecofin Council of Finance Ministers did not manage to reach a common position on this set of problems. However, we know that this issue is absolutely central. The European Commission had already made its proposals and I very much hope that we can take the initiative and carry our partners with us to achieve the global solidarity required to overcome the problem of climate change.","Mr President, I would like to continue with the argument from my speech yesterday on the preparations for the Copenhagen summit, and then mention yesterday’s Ecofin meeting, which was not hugely successful.

Daciana Octavia Sârbu ,S&D," European livestock farmers have been facing ever-growing difficulties recently. They are finding it difficult to cope with competition from third countries as the latter do not comply with the high standards which local producers comply with, and they are always victims of the European Union’s commercial negotiations. However, we hope that we will see a different attitude adopted by the European Commission in future because it is not normal for European farmers to always lose out as a result of commercial agreements. The Commission also needs to be more involved in strengthening producer organisations in all livestock sectors, in order to enable them to negotiate better prices for their products, while taking into account production costs. At the same time, I call on the Commission to release as quickly as possible cereals from the intervention stocks to support this sector which has been hit hard by the crisis.","European livestock farmers have been facing ever-growing difficulties recently.

Apreciez, în acest context, eforturile Comisiei Europene de a promova prin politicile sale un consum de alimente sănătoase. În același timp, trebuie să fim conștienți de faptul că producția în sistem BIO este mult mai dificil de realizat comparativ cu producția în sistem convențional. Astfel, fermierii trebuie să fie bine plătiți pentru aceste eforturi într-un mod care să contribuie la bunăstarea lor și să le asigure un trai decent.

Jessika Roswall ,N/A," President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to address this Chamber. Today, we are witnessing uncertain times in Europe and globally. This is putting our economies under intense strain and requires new ways of thinking and decisive collective action. That is why today’s debate about the Commission’s communication on a Green Deal Industrial Plan is very timely. The Commission’s plans provide a basis for us to reflect on what we need to do in the short term to strengthen our industrial and technological base. We also need to analyse further the potential negative consequences of actions taken by other global actors. But, even more importantly, we cannot simply react to external events. If we want the EU to be a leader in clean tech and other fields, we have to be proactive and get serious about strengthening our productivity in the long term. Therefore, it is essential that we start work on removing barriers for productivity and enhancing investments in clean and digital technologies. Predictable and competitive conditions for our companies across the EU will help us to become the frontrunner of the green and digital transition. With this purpose in mind, the Special European Council last week underlined the need to intensify the work along several strands of action. For instance, we need to simplify the regulatory framework and shorten administrative procedures. This is crucial to ensure that we have the necessary manufacturing capacity to reach the EU’s climate—neutral goals. To ensure a successful green and digital transition in Europe, we need to equip citizens with the appropriate skills. We have to take ambitious action to provide education, training, upskilling and reskilling. In order to grow and thrive, businesses also need access to capital. Existing EU funds can play a part, but even more important is private investment. Therefore, we need to finalise the Capital Markets Union to make sure that Europe can remain a continent of production and innovation. But we cannot stop at Europe’s borders. To be world—leading, European companies must have access to world markets. Thus, the European Council stressed the importance of supporting the WTO and the multilateral rules—based system for trade. Fair and transparent free trade and investment agreements should allow resilient and reliable supply chains to develop and the European Union to access new markets. These are fundamental pillars for drawing up a Green Deal Industrial Plan for a net—zero age. Last but not least, let me add that we look forward to the Commission’s proposal for a long—term strategy at the EU level to boost competitiveness and productivity. Working on the long—term challenges of increasing productivity will be crucial for attracting investment, as well as safeguarding our businesses’ and industries’ ability to compete globally. This is a discussion that we will come back to many times during the spring and indeed in the coming years. It is about making our economy more futureproof and recovering the lost ground. Despite the pressing issues of the day, this is a challenge we must tackle now.","President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to address this Chamber.

Saïd El Khadraoui,S&D," To begin with, speaking on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I, too, wish to express my heartfelt sympathy for the victims of the Buizingen rail disaster and their families and friends. We do have to await the results of the investigation before drawing real, detailed conclusions, of course, but that does not change the fact that railway safety must remain a permanent area of attention at all levels, including the European level, and that we must therefore evaluate, improve, supplement and adjust safety policy on a regular basis. I should like to join my fellow Member and also you, Commissioner, in making quite clear our regret that a number of individuals with significant responsibilities in Belgium have sought to pass responsibility for the accident on to Europe or have at least given that impression. The delay in the development of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) has been cited in particular as a reason why now, in 2010, only a handful of locomotives in Belgium are equipped with the automatic stop system. Ladies and gentlemen, on the other hand, let us make one thing clear, and let us be frank about this: the development of this good idea – a single signalling system to replace the 20 separate systems – has taken longer than hoped or expected. This, of course, is attributable to the technical complexity and to the fact that agreement on a standard has to be reached among a very large number of countries, namely 27, although at the time, there were a couple fewer. Of course, there are also associated budgetary consequences. Yet, as you rightly said, this has not stopped a single Member State from developing its own system or starting to use a kind of embryonic version of ERTMS at an early stage. I take the view that we do need to look ahead now and ask ourselves how we can contribute to safer railways. I believe we can make this contribution on several fronts at European level, too. We can do so, firstly, thanks to the further development of ERTMS. Such a development plan exists. In 2009, we earmarked EUR 240 million from the budget for trans-European transport networks (TEN-T) in order to help Member States out with this. Secondly, however, and I think that this is an important task for the Commission and the European Railway Agency, we must also monitor whether existing European safety legislation is being implemented in practice in the field. I would cite the example of Directive 2004/49/EC on safety on the Community’s railways. This lays down, among other things, that a safety authority is to be established in each Member State, which must be independent from the railway undertakings and the infrastructure manager, and whose tasks include monitoring, encouraging and enforcing railway safety and developing a regulatory framework. I have the feeling, ladies and gentlemen, that this is not working particularly well in Belgium, and I think that you should organise a kind of audit to look into whether Member States do indeed have the capacity to guarantee this safety proactively in their national rail systems. That is a task I should like to entrust to you.","To begin with, speaking on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I, too, wish to express my heartfelt sympathy for the victims of the Buizingen rail disaster and their families and friends.

Jakop G. Dalunde,N/A,"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. – Madam President, dear colleagues, Commissioner, the growing threats posed by digitalisation and the surge of cyberattacks underline that the weakest link is often the one from which a chain reaction can happen, and in an economy increasingly dependent on the digital domain, this can have catastrophic results on our society. We need to increase our collective readiness and ensure that a high common level of cybersecurity is attained across our Union. In this proposal I welcome the strengthening of the security requirements, reporting obligations, the more stringent supervisory measures and stricter enforcement requirements, including harmonised sanctions across the European Union, and in this work we Greens focused on interoperability, transparency, open source and encryption. On these issues we made some important steps forward, but there is more work to be done to ensure that we are fit for fighting the cybersecurity challenges of tomorrow.","rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. – Madam President, dear colleagues, Commissioner, the growing threats posed by digitalisation and the surge of cyberattacks underline that the weakest link is often the one from which a chain reaction can happen, and in an economy increasingly dependent on the digital domain, this can have catastrophic results on our society.

În final, ca urmare a exemplului pozitiv oferit de medicii și asistenții europeni, în mod special cei din România, care în timpul pandemiei s-au oferit voluntar pentru a ajuta în alte state europene, am propus crearea unei unități medicale permanente, axată pe intervențiile de urgență în zonele cele mai afectate.

However, I would agree with those members who have said that savings are necessary, especially making budget savings. It is a fact that the European budget has been shrinking for decades. Looking at the GDP we have generated in the EU, its volume has constantly decreased. Recently, the Commissioner has said that, at the very beginning of the financial perspective, EU gross domestic product was approximately 1.3%. That figure today is barely 1.12%. At the same time, though, national European budgets have increased significantly. For example, over the past ten years, the proverbially modest UK budget has increased by 100%, hence two and half times more than the EU budget. I would like to hear the Commissioner comment, in particular, on whether he is likely to encounter any difficulties in implementing the next budget in 2012 because of this actual decrease in the European budget as compared to the national budgets of the Member States.","Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to start by congratulating Mr Fernandes on an excellent report.

However, as is always the case when there is something fundamentally harmful in an agreement negotiated by the Commission, everything is done in secret. I am thinking of the Blair House Agreement, which sacrificed European farming to feed the appetites of the US agri­food multinationals. I am also thinking of the scandalous MAI, the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, which sought to exempt multinationals from the laws in force in the countries in which they were operating. Fortunately, that agreement did not see the light of day. In this instance, it is the ‘Internet’ section of ACTA that is in question: it literally boils down to introducing a monstrous worldwide ‘Hadopi’ law. Customs could search the MP3 players, mobile telephones and laptops of any citizen suspected of having illegally downloaded a file. Access providers may be forced to cut their customers’ connection or to supply information on them. This is unacceptable, and that is why we have voted in favour of this resolution, which calls for complete transparency in the negotiations and threatens to drag the Commission through the courts if it refuses.","This draft Anti­Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, may seem like a good idea, so great is the suffering of the European economy and European jobs as a result of these unfair practices in the world of excessive free trade that you are imposing on us.

It is essential for the EU to learn from the experience of providing effective aid after previous disasters, for example, in Australia, Haiti and Russia, in order to have completely clear procedures and resources for providing effective humanitarian aid. The continent of Europe has so far avoided disasters on such a scale, but this does not mean that we should not prepare an effective range of structures and resources. Experience from recent years shows that securing transport into affected areas is not possible without technical and organisational support from military units. Non-governmental humanitarian organisations do not have these capabilities. It is evident that the inhabitants of affected areas very often remain cut off in terms of transport links around the country, and the capacity of civil aviation resources is limited. If the use of military forces is justifiable and acceptable anywhere, then it is surely in the case of humanitarian or natural disasters.","The submitted report is a very timely response to the many natural disasters we have experienced in recent years.

Indeed, as Ms Schaldemose said, ‘we do not have two and a half planets, we just have one’. So it’s high time we do more for more sustainable consumption, which is more environmentally friendly. We try to do it in a holistic way, coordinating policy actions between different policy areas. Only such an approach can reconcile all related aspects and interests with the overall aim of more sustainable consumption and effective consumer rights, as well as the interests of the manufacturing industry and the retail and repair business.  As we heard here several times, we should avoid disproportionate costs. It must not be projected into increased prices for the consumers, and it should be a win—win situation, as Dita Charanzová said. We also heard, for instance from Mr Schwab and Mr Jurzyca, about the point or aspect of innovations. We should not hinder innovations by introducing measures which would go against technological development. You spoke about refrigerators here and some domestic machines and devices. I love the manual meat grinder which I got from my granny. I love it. It’s the oldest thing I have in my household. It’s even older than me, and it’s very sustainable. More than 70 years old. Can you imagine? This is real quality. But I do not think that we want to use these manual things forever so we understand that we have to be open to technological innovations as well. Your resolution is a most valuable input and support for our common political aim to achieve more sustainable consumption.

Låt oss dock samtidigt komma ihåg att en fungerande frihandel kräver gemensamma spelregler. Det är grunden för den europeiska välfärden och tillväxten. Vill vi undvika en situation där alla krigar mot alla, såsom president Trump förespråkar, så måste vi stå upp för samarbetet inom WTO även när det inte direkt gynnar oss.","– Fru talman!

Vincenzo Sofo,ECR," – Signora Presidente, signor Commissario Gentiloni, onorevoli colleghi, l'idea di potenziare i programmi per assistere gli Stati membri nel contrastare frodi è sicuramente positiva, visti i danni che fenomeni come l'evasione fiscale arrecano a paesi come l'Italia. Temo tuttavia che non servirà a nulla, se non sarà associata a una vera politica di contrasto di quella vergognosa frode legalizzata che la stessa UE continua a tollerare al suo interno, quella del dumping fiscale: concorrenza sleale di alcuni Stati membri che offrono alle società tasse irrisorie per traslocare fittiziamente sul loro territorio, agendo da veri paradisi fiscali. Una frode che rappresenta circa il 25 % dell'elusione fiscale mondiale e il 90 % di quella ai danni dell'Italia; una frode che ruba ogni anno oltre 5 miliardi di entrate allo Stato italiano, che si rifà depredando lavoratori e piccole imprese. Eppure su questo fronte, che dovrebbe essere prioritario, la Commissione fa orecchie da mercante. Commissario Gentiloni, Lei, ad esempio, aveva risposto alla mia interrogazione promettendo misure concrete entro fine 2020 e ieri in quest'Aula ci ha annunciato grandi passi in avanti in tema di imposte societarie. Ma per ora la realtà appare assai diversa. Sono state infatti affossate proposte già esistenti per ripartire da zero e garantire così a questi paradisi fiscali almeno altri due anni di tranquillità, quando la Commissione andrà verso scadenza di mandato e non avrà più la forza politica di agire, così come l'UE non ha avuto la forza politica di agire per negare gli aiuti economici legati alla crisi COVID a chi ha sede nei paradisi fiscali europei. Quel che appare, dunque, Commissario Gentiloni, è piuttosto un'Europa che vuol dare parvenza di un coraggio da leone ma che, quando c'è da combattere le vere ingiustizie, ebbene, si trasforma magicamente in coniglio.","– Signora Presidente, signor Commissario Gentiloni, onorevoli colleghi, l'idea di potenziare i programmi per assistere gli Stati membri nel contrastare frodi è sicuramente positiva, visti i danni che fenomeni come l'evasione fiscale arrecano a paesi come l'Italia.

Clemente Mastella ,PPE," Information and communication technology (ICT) is now an integral part the economy and society of the European Union. Today, due to the continuing evolution of media and information systems, ICT is increasingly exposed to threats that cannot be addressed effectively at a national level alone. Therefore, let us welcome favourably the Commission’s proposal for a radical reform of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) and the extension of its mandate for another 18 months, which will allow us to overcome the risk of a dangerous legal vacuum. There is no doubt that the proliferation of security requirements involve costs for companies that are active within the EU, resulting in extensive fragmentation and lack of competitiveness in the internal European market. On the other hand, while the dependence on networks and information systems increases, the ability to respond to problems still seems inadequate. ENISA needs, therefore, to carry forward its commitments by adopting strategies designed to identify risks and vulnerabilities related to network and information security, enabling us to identify and deal with the challenges that we will have to face in the near future.","Information and communication technology is now an integral part the economy and society of the European Union.

Marian Harkin ,ALDE,"Mr President, I want to indicate my strong support for the Rapti report. Perhaps my main concern is that, in times of austerity, European citizens look to the EU to help provide a safety net and, while the actions we can take at European level are limited, nonetheless the universal service obligation is a mechanism which can support citizens where market forces have failed. Indeed we have plenty of examples of that happening in recent times, especially where the financial markets have failed European citizens. As I said, circumstances have changed and therefore, in that context, we do need to re-evaluate how appropriate existing legislative provisions are for universal service. We need to ensure that the real needs of citizens are met. Finally, 112, the European emergency number; it is a great idea, but we must ensure that Member States provide timely, accurate and reliable location information on the 112 service. If we can do that, then a full-scale promotion of the number, a European emergency number, is warranted.

Brando Benifei ,S&D,"Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, abbiamo di fronte a noi un testo importante che servirà a creare un organismo europeo di alto livello che si pone un obiettivo assolutamente centrale, quello di contrastare il lavoro sommerso. Sappiamo bene che questo problema non si limita a essere esclusivamente un peso per le finanze pubbliche, generando evasione fiscale e concorrenza sleale fra le imprese, ma rappresenta soprattutto una fonte di seri rischi per i lavoratori e la società in generale. È una minaccia per la salute e la sicurezza dei lavoratori che spesso sono impiegati in settori usuranti e pericolosi, quali il settore agricolo, edile e industriale. È un problema per la tenuta del tessuto sociale, anche inteso in senso geografico e di genere. Colpisce inoltre i gruppi più vulnerabili, inclusi i rifugiati. È giusto dunque che l'Unione europea si sforzi a trovare una soluzione e far sedere allo stesso tavolo rappresentanti degli Stati membri, della Commissione europea e della società civile, fra cui i sindacati e i datori di lavoro, servirà a identificare la dimensione europea del problema. A mio parere, un obiettivo di lungo periodo che dobbiamo porci è proprio quello della regolarizzazione del lavoro nero.

Seemingly there is nothing wrong with that, but in fact there is – and there is plenty. Let me go through what is wrong. There is absolutely no legal nor Treaty mandate to establish this mechanism. The EU has therefore absolutely no right even to propose it. Thirdly, there is nothing that can be cited to justify or validate such a mechanism, and the timing should make everybody suspicious. Call me cynical, but might it just be a knee—jerk reaction to circumstances in Poland and Hungary – two Member States – probably two out of 28 that would like to do much the same – which are, quite rightly, exercising their sovereign right to curtail EU influence and control in the areas of democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights? That is what sovereign nationhood is all about. If the European Union really wishes to add more substance to accusations of covert federalism and emerging Big Brother statehood, then go ahead, but there is absolutely no way anybody who believes in democracy should support this.","Madam President, all too often what the EU has in mind is either obscure or opaque, ensuring that the media and Member States’ citizens are left in the dark.

Maria do Céu Patrão Neves ,PPE," This report refers to a draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union on certain aspects of air services. Given that the EU currently has exclusive competence in this area, the Council has authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries in order to replace the traditional bilateral agreements on air services between the Member States and third countries. The draft agreement was examined by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which issued a favourable opinion. From this, I would like to highlight, among other points, the establishment of a Community designation clause in order to avoid discrimination between EU air carriers and allow the taxation of aircraft fuel for operations within the territory of the European Union. I would like to emphasise these two points in the favourable opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as these caused me to vote in favour of this report.","This report refers to a draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union on certain aspects of air services.

Jan Březina ,PPE," We have voted today, among other things, on proposals concerning the legislative package on financial supervision in the European Union. The dispute over the form of financial supervision concerns the extent of the powers given to the newly established European institution supervising the operations of the banks, insurance companies and financial markets. We must proceed with cool heads in our justified efforts to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis, and not give in to hysteria. The European financial market institutions should properly complement the national ones, rather than elbowing them off the playing field. The problems of a bank, insurance company or investment fund should always be resolved by the supervisory authority which is closest to the situation and which can therefore assess and evaluate it most sensitively. In many cases, this is not and will not be a European regulator. In my opinion, it is essential to have a national government veto over decisions of the European regulators, in order to prevent the seductive but dangerous application of a uniform procedure in a disaster situation which might vary across the financial markets of the Member States. Newly established European financial supervisory institutions with practically unlimited powers would be like a Leviathan, to which the states would trustingly surrender their sovereign power, and which would be all the more vulnerable in the event that this power was used incorrectly or even abused.","We have voted today, among other things, on proposals concerning the legislative package on financial supervision in the European Union.

Liam Aylward,ALDE,"Mr President, can I begin by wishing the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, well in the many challenges that she faces during her mandate. As she knows well, and as the United Nations has stated, the situation in Haiti is the worst humanitarian disaster in decades, as the numbers of missing people, victims and deaths continue to rise. The human cost of this tragedy is immeasurable. While relief aid is beginning to arrive, we are all aware of the significant problems that aid workers are facing in trying to get assistance to those that need it most. Increasing security, logistical and bureaucracy problems have been identified by the NGOs on the ground as hampering aid and making a disastrous situation worse. These are the problems that are swaying the balance between life and death for Haitians. In all the frayed work to alleviate the suffering and chaos, clear leadership and coordinated assistance are needed. NGOs, government bodies, international organisations and local authorities must work together to deliver multisector emergency assistance to those in need. It is clear that the country needs massive international support immediately. The response from European citizens and their record generosity and solidarity have been immense. Yesterday’s announcement of over EUR 420 million in European Union humanitarian aid for Haiti shows leadership and commitment, but its delivery must be coordinated and effective. The European Union’s stated aim is to consolidate and strengthen the global relief effort. I hope that you, Mrs Ashton, and Commissioner De Gucht, work strongly towards this aim in the respective visits to the United States, Haiti and elsewhere later this week. The long-term development of the poorest nation in the western hemisphere must become a priority. The allocation of EUR 200 million in European Union aid to help Haiti rebuild in the long term is a positive start, but, when the cameras have left and the world’s attention is turned elsewhere, the European Union, as a global leader, must act and live up to its responsibility.","Mr President, can I begin by wishing the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, well in the many challenges that she faces during her mandate.

Die zukünftig zulässigen Abweichungen von den heute bestehenden Obergrenzen der Fahrzeugabmessungen sind ein Beitrag, um den Straßenverkehr sicherer, umweltfreundlicher und energieeffizienter zu machen. Der große Wurf, um den Straßengüterverkehr auch wirtschaftlicher und zukunftssicher zu machen, ist mit ihnen nicht gelungen. Natürlich bringt die Verbesserung der Aerodynamik der Fahrzeuge im Front- und im Heckbereich ohne Beeinträchtigung der Ladeflächenkapazität eine Effizienzsteigerung. Bei einer moderaten Verlängerung der Sattelzugkombination um 1,3 Meter wäre sogar eine bessere Kompatibilität mit 48-Fuß-Containern und dem Bahnverkehr erreichbar. Durch die Veränderung der Form des Fahrerhauses wird sich der tote Winkel im Sichtfeld des Fahrers verkleinern, wodurch insbesondere die Belange der schutzbedürftigen Straßenverkehrsteilnehmer wie Fußgänger und Radfahrer berücksichtigt werden.

Taxation policy remains a matter for Member States and, in any case, there are many more pressing priorities if we are to attract new investment. Most important is the need to complete the single market.

As a result of this, there are a number of Member States where it is very hard to start a business.

Where is the additionality there? Secondly, this one should also be for the countries mostly affected by the crisis. How can you explain that Greece only has one project on infrastructure and one SME project? That is really one of the regions most affected by the crisis, yet it is not benefiting from EFSI at all. That is also a genuine problem. Thirdly, this should be a transition of the economy. Bank Watch concluded that, without EFSI, the EIB is subsidising 25% of the projects related to climate. With EFSI it is 27%. It seems like business as usual.

Clare Daly,GUE/NGL," – Madam President, I was actually very glad to hear Ms Mogherini talk about Europe’s continued opposition to the unilateral withdrawal of the US from the Iranian nuclear deal and the efforts to attempt to salvage that programme. But I think we have to go further and we have to acknowledge that the imposition of sanctions to coerce Iran has caused immense hardship on Iranian citizens and the poor and the vulnerable in particular – the very people that we are protesting that we need to defend.  We now have the spectacle of the US attempting to exploit the legitimate and authentic protests in Iraq and Lebanon in order to target Iran. I think we should be very careful not to fall for that trap. Mike Pompeo says the protests are caused by Iranian corruption. These are real people, with real problems: corruption, under—development, a wrecked economy. The Iraqis are still dealing with the after—effects of the Iraq war. We should not allow ourselves to fall into the trap of US manipulation. We must work for stability in Iran and Iraq and Lebanon, and peace in Syria and Yemen and oppose the US—Saudi attempts to isolate Iran.","– Madam President, I was actually very glad to hear Ms Mogherini talk about Europe’s continued opposition to the unilateral withdrawal of the US from the Iranian nuclear deal and the efforts to attempt to salvage that programme.

Molly Scott Cato ,Greens/EFA,"Mr President, I am convinced that the Commission’s tax package indicates a genuine desire to challenge the power of multinational corporations to use their cosy relationship with governments to minimise their tax payments. The era of there being one rule for corporations and another for the little people must come to an end. I am less convinced about the commitment of UK Chancellor George Osborne to the fight against tax avoidance. He may be good at pretending to do something radical in London, but in Brussels he is doing everything he can to make sure these proposals do not become law. So I was pleased to see him calling for public country-by-country reporting of company profits and tax returns – but perhaps he needs to check the voting records of his own Members here in this House, who recently voted against an amendment to achieve just this. As MEPs who represent small businesses and citizens who are bearing an unfair tax burden, we are tired of tax competition and even more tired of competition over tax rhetoric. We are tired of politicians who make the right noises when the latest scandal hits the headlines but then vote to protect corporations and their sweetheart tax deals. As Greens, we are determined to end corporate tax avoidance, and as shadow rapporteur on the country-by-country reporting part of the package, I will be watching how Osborne behaves when the Commission package reaches the Council. It is then that his words will be tested with action, and the British people will not forgive him if he continues to protect the corporations and his words issued in the heat of the moment are seen to mean nothing.","Mr President, I am convinced that the Commission’s tax package indicates a genuine desire to challenge the power of multinational corporations to use their cosy relationship with governments to minimise their tax payments.

This made you the epicenter of history, and this history made you what you are: an island of geopolitical pitfalls and geopolitical aspirations. As Chair of the Delegation of the European Union to EU—Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I salute your humanitarian efforts in the wake of the terrible earthquake in Turkey. I strongly believe that the Cyprus conflict can be overcome and I commend your personal dedication to breaking the deadlock with the help of your allies. Our solidarity to the Republic of Cyprus is – and will remain – unbroken, and this must be made clear to all the regional powers.

Ska Keller,Greens/EFA,"Madam President, I want to ask the view of the Commission and the Presidency on the non-Syrians because, although in theory non—Syrians can ask for asylum in Turkey, in practice the recognition rates are really marginal. They are far, far below European Union recognition rates. At the same time, Turkey is making readmission agreements with countries like Afghanistan and Iraq. So how does this fit in with your idea of a safe third country? The legal access of refugees that you mentioned really is a sham. The numbers are marginal. Everybody has been saying how many refugees Turkey has been taking on board – like 3 billion or something – but, if we take a maximum number of 72 000 (which is a whole sham itself), then this is absolutely marginal. Again, what about non—Syrians: how are they supposed to find protection in the European Union? And where is the solidarity with Greece that you mentioned? Or the asylum officers, interpreters, judicial officers, promised by various Member States? Very few have actually been sent so far. It does not seem to me that Europe is really functioning. Instead we are pushing the responsibility to Turkey, pushing the responsibility to Greece and, worse, we are letting down the people who are in need of international protection and who are fleeing from war and persecution.

It’s our duty to ensure that every single girl – not only in the EU, but around the world – has access to quality education, healthcare and job opportunities, and is able to enjoy a life where they are truly equal. But sadly, these are universal rights that millions are still denied. We must demand that gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls continues to be a top priority in the EU’s international cooperation and development policies. We must dismantle patriarchal social norms that have been formed and cemented over generations, as well as challenging and changing discriminatory laws.

However, the EU budget can only be seen as offering huge added value with regard to investments made at national level. The Commission’s proposal freezes ceilings at their 2013 levels and significantly weakens the requests made by the Special Committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 to strengthen European policies to enhance competitiveness, small and medium-sized enterprises and sustainable infrastructure. Parliament hopes for a ‘responsible’ reaction from the Council.

Rupert Lowe,NI," – Madam President, I am sure everybody in this House joins me in sending prayers and best wishes to the Australian people as they deal with this national catastrophe. It’s disappointing that climate change has been blamed as the primary cause of these devastating bushfires by both our Parliament and other so—called climate experts. The cult of climate change marches on with no definitive evidence to support or deny the factual accuracy of their assertions. Logic suggests that climate change has little to do with this natural catastrophe. Higher human population density, resulting in more discarded cigarettes, sparks from electric transmission lines, campfires and, worst of all, arson are more likely causes of the problem. Traditional Aboriginal managed burning at the right time of year has been shunned or banned without any understanding of the consequences. This Parliament needs to urgently address its own excessive, avoidable carbon footprint by rationalising the waste associated with running three Parliament buildings in different geographic locations. We must end the culture of ‘do as I say, not as I do’, and be judged by what our hands are doing, not by what our mouth is saying. Anything less smacks of do-gooding hypocrisy.

Peter Jahr ,PPE," Madam President, Mr Diamandouros, Commissioner, the institution of the Ombudsman has had a very impressive history in Europe. Taking a concept originally developed in Sweden, ombudsmen have been trying to resolve disputes and problems on an impartial basis for 200 years now. I believe that the idea of an ombudsman derives from a deep human need for the resolution of disputes by peaceful means. This report is the fifteenth such report by the Ombudsman for Europe and the seventh by Mr Diamandouros. This is a record to be proud of and I would like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros. When he was elected last year, I expressed the hope that the Ombudsman would do his utmost to ensure that the decision-making process within the EU was more transparent and relevant to its citizens and that we would collaborate effectively with the Committee on Petitions. I think we can safely say that together, we have succeeded in this. I still see room for improvement in the coordination between the functions and tasks of the Ombudsman and those of the Committee on Petitions. We are increasingly in receipt of petitions that touch on aspects of the classic right of petition, as well as elements of the Ombudsman’s duties. I am talking about human rights, property rights and obstacles to economic activity. It is reasonable and appropriate that we should work together in these areas so that we can tackle the Commission together in a positive sense and get the relevant responses within the required timeframe. I would also like to welcome the new website with the interactive guidelines that should help ensure that people are made aware of the opportunities available to them to have their voice heard in Europe. I hope that Mr Diamandouros continues to succeed in his good and important work and that he will manage to introduce improvements wherever possible. The Committee on Petitions will also continue to do all it can to promote close cooperation with the Ombudsman in the future in the interests of the citizens of the European Union.","Madam President, Mr Diamandouros, Commissioner, the institution of the Ombudsman has had a very impressive history in Europe.

Mick Wallace,GUE/NGL," – Madam President, the right to timely access to affordable, preventative and curative healthcare of good quality is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The EU and all its Member States have ratified this Convention. Yet, in Ireland last week, the Health Service Executive were forced to apologise to the families of children across the country who cannot access disability services. Earlier this year, Inclusion Ireland conducted a survey among families with children with disabilities. Over 50 % of the families of children surveyed were not in receipt of any disability service. Over 85 % of them have waited for over a year. How in God’s name can the Irish Government stand over this? And is there any way that the EU can actually pressure the Irish Government to do the right thing in the area of disabilities?","– Madam President, the right to timely access to affordable, preventative and curative healthcare of good quality is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Emer Costello ,S&D,"I regret that an amendment to the Sonik report recommending that Member States do not authorise any new fracking operations in the EU was not accepted, though I do acknowledge that this, ultimately, is a matter for each Member State to decide for itself. The Sonik report advocates a cautious EU approach to fracking until informed conclusions can be arrived at on the basis of Commission studies assessing the appropriateness of existing EU legislation in this area, the implications for public health, climate change, land-use, and water, and other relevant aspects. The report was strengthened by S&D amendments in these areas. Based on its findings, the Commission should prepare proposals for appropriate measures such as new EU legislation, where needed. The EU should introduce mandatory environmental impact assessments for explanatory drilling as well as a ban on fracking in sensitive areas such as drinking water protection zones and mining areas.

Joachim Stanisław Brudziński,ECR," – Pani Przewodnicząca! Szanowni Państwo! Bardzo ważne są słowa, bardzo ważne są deklaracje. Bardzo ważne jest takie werbalne poparcie, ale wydaje się, że najważniejsze są konkrety. Ja o takich konkretach chciałbym parę słów powiedzieć.  Od pierwszych dni wojny na Ukrainie strona polska, mój kraj, jest zaangażowana w pomoc, która w obszarze kultury przyjmuje formy od bezpośredniego wsparcia indywidualnych artystów ukraińskich, poprzez wsparcie na rzecz instytucji edukacyjnych i kultury, aż po działania służące ochronie dziedzictwa kultury.  Równolegle do działań na poziomie wspólnotowym Polska podjęła szereg działań, aby wspomóc ludzi kultury z Ukrainy. Uruchomione zostały rezydencje, programy stypendialne i dotacyjne, które adresowane są do ukraińskich twórców i ich rodzin. Przykładowo w odpowiedzi na rezydencje dla ludzi teatru, muzyki i tańca zgłosiło się już ponad sto instytucji gotowych gościć artystów z Ukrainy. Chęć skorzystania z rezydencji wyraziło ok. 340 artystów, a kolejne zgłoszenia wciąż napływają. Na ten cel Ministerstwo Kultury i Dziedzictwa Narodowego przeznaczyło ponad jeden milion euro.  Podobnie w obszarze produkcji filmowych powstaje program dotacyjny dedykowany polsko-ukraińskim inicjatywom filmowym tworzonym przez Polski Instytut Sztuki Filmowej. Tutaj kwota proponowana na to wsparcie to również około jednego miliona euro.  W Polsce od początku wojny istnieje zespół, obecnie Centrum Pomocy na rzecz Ukraińskiego Dziedzictwa, którego głównym zadaniem jest odpowiedź na konkretne potrzeby zgłaszane przez instytucje z Ukrainy. Dotychczas Centrum nawiązało współpracę z ponad 50 instytucjami. Dostarcza specjalistyczny sprzęt i materiały do profesjonalnego zabezpieczenia budynków i zbiorów, jak również pomoc materialną pozwalającą na codzienne funkcjonowanie. W pierwszym okresie wojny na Ukrainę wysłano 19 transportów na kwotę miliona euro.","– Pani Przewodnicząca! Szanowni Państwo! Bardzo ważne są słowa, bardzo ważne są deklaracje.

Seán Kelly,PPE," – A Uachtaráin, the climate crisis is increasingly affecting the lives of millions of people across the world. This year, Pakistan endured extreme weather conditions: from its heat wave in March and April, to the devastating floods in June.  Pakistan was one of the country’s worst affected by climate change in the first years of this century. This climate-induced crisis has come on top of an ongoing political and economic crisis. After the heaviest monsoons in over a century, 1 600 people lost their lives and approximately 13 000 people were injured, in addition to the millions of homes lost. The floods have also had a devastating effect on Pakistan’s agriculture, which plays a central role in the country’s economy.  It is essential that the EU stand with the people of Pakistan, a country with which we have strong bilateral relations for over 60 years. I welcome the funding and supports that have been provided already. Europe has offered humanitarian funding, provided medical aid and exported essential equipment, such as water pumps and hygiene kits.  I would like to make a broader point. In Europe our primary focus is on the unjust war in Ukraine and the resulting energy crisis, which poses immediate and acute dangers. Climate change, on the other hand, has not gone away. It poses an existential problem for the human race, and the effects are plain to see.","– A Uachtaráin, the climate crisis is increasingly affecting the lives of millions of people across the world.

Monika Hohlmeier ,PPE,"Herr Präsident, meine Herren Präsidenten, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Zunächst einmal sollten wir hier versuchen, seriös miteinander umzugehen und auch keinen falschen Eindruck zu erwecken. Als Erstes: Das Problem der 50 Millionen Flüchtlinge, die unterwegs sind, lässt sich nicht mit einem Handstreich lösen. Wir sollten auch nicht den Eindruck erwecken, als könnten wir hier kurzfristig mit ein paar Maßnahmen alle Lösungen für 50 Millionen Flüchtlinge finden. Wir müssen einen Beitrag leisten. Was heißt „Beitrag leisten“? Es bedeutet erstens: Wir müssen natürlich Such- und Rettungsaktionen starten, um die Menschen im Mittelmeer zu retten. Aber hier spricht niemand über die Sahara-Zone, wo mindestens so viele Menschen sterben. Und nur, weil wir sie nicht sehen, existieren die Toten dort trotzdem. Aus dem Grund muss es zweitens auch endlich eine Afrikapolitik geben, die umgesetzt wird. Wir haben seit 2007 angeblich eine Afrikapolitik. In Wirklichkeit haben wir 28 bzw. 29 Entwicklungshilfepolitiken, die nicht konzertiert auf den afrikanischen Kontinent mit einwirken. Denn auch dort liegt Verantwortlichkeit und nicht allein in der Europäischen Union. Auch afrikanische Staaten tragen Verantwortung für ihre Bürgerinnen und Bürger. Als Drittes: Wir müssen Menschenhändler endlich einmal bekämpfen! Ich habe kein Verständnis dafür, dass vonseiten der GUE/NGL immer wieder, wenn es um Diskussionen über den Kampf gegen Menschenhändler geht, jedes Mal Maßnahmen kritisch betrachtet werden und wir da keinen ernsthaften internationalen Kampf gegen brutalste Verbrecher zustande bringen, die zu ihrem eigenen Vorteil töten, foltern und morden. Das sind Terroristen, das sind organisierte Kriminelle, und wir müssen dagegenwirken. Und dann gibt es den dritten Weg, über den wir seriös miteinander reden müssen. Das ist das Thema der sogenannten legalen Migration. Man muss tatsächlich trennen: Arbeitsmigration und das Thema Flüchtlinge und humanitäre Migration. Wir haben Instrumente wie die Neuansiedlung, die muss man ausbauen. Das heißt, wir brauchen nicht endlos neue Instrumente, sondern die, die wir haben, müssen wir nutzen. Wir können auch weitere Instrumente hinzufügen, wenn wir dies sortiert und sinnvoll tun. Aber es ist immer nur ein Beitrag gegen die Katastrophe. Jetzt populistisch eine kurzfristige Lösung zu fordern, ist schlichtweg nicht die Wahrheit.

Paul Tang,S&D," – Madam President, welcome, Commissioner Gentiloni. Sometimes a picture says more than a thousand words. When Lagarde tweeted a photo of her first ECB governing council, it said more than any of us could ever say. Flanked by baroque paintings and underneath a classic chandelier, smiling at the camera were the faces of Ms Lagarde and 24 men. I had to look again. Is this really 2019? Were it not for the iPads on the conference tables, I would have thought it was from the days of De Gaulle or from Jean Monnet instead of Sanna Marin. As an economist by training, I know that many of us are used to male-dominated settings and have become desensitised. But this photo should awaken us. It shows that the battle for gender-equality remains urgent and one that concerns us all. This is why, not only I personally, but also the Social Democrats and the European Parliament call on the Council to put forward two candidates for ECB positions: a man and a woman. I know this might be a long shot. Nominations are proposed by the Eurogroup, which holds among its 19 members just one woman. But – and I’m firm on this – if the Council doesn’t update its appointment procedure to the 21st century, we should vote against it. How can we get fair decisions when half of our population is all but excluded from decision-making? How can our policies create a modern economy when they are made in a setting of an age long gone? Schnabel and Panetta have both committed to promoting gender-equality upon their appointment. They have a hell of a job to do. I hope they will put their words into action.","– Madam President, welcome, Commissioner Gentiloni. Sometimes a picture says more than a thousand words.

This is why, not only I personally, but also the Social Democrats and the European Parliament call on the Council to put forward two candidates for ECB positions: a man and a woman. I know this might be a long shot. Nominations are proposed by the Eurogroup, which holds among its 19 members just one woman. But – and I’m firm on this – if the Council doesn’t update its appointment procedure to the 21st century, we should vote against it. How can we get fair decisions when half of our population is all but excluded from decision-making? How can our policies create a modern economy when they are made in a setting of an age long gone? Schnabel and Panetta have both committed to promoting gender-equality upon their appointment. They have a hell of a job to do. I hope they will put their words into action.","– Madam President, welcome, Commissioner Gentiloni. Sometimes a picture says more than a thousand words. When Lagarde tweeted a photo of her first ECB governing council, it said more than any of us could ever say. Flanked by baroque paintings and underneath a classic chandelier, smiling at the camera were the faces of Ms Lagarde and 24 men. I had to look again. Is this really 2019? Were it not for the iPads on the conference tables, I would have thought it was from the days of De Gaulle or from ",nan

Brian Monteith,NI," – Mr President, free trade brings prosperity; it lifts all our boats. Protectionism through subsidies and tariffs is the enemy of free trade and prosperity. Subsidies and tariffs are doomed to fail: they make us all poorer. Singapore, without any natural resource except for its people, did not bargain away its tariffs; it unilaterally abolished them. Now its prosperity is the envy of the world. US tariffs are a response to EU subsidies in European steel and aviation. The EU introduced 25% tariffs on American whiskey and bourbon. Now the US is levying 25% tariffs on Scotch malt whisky. The way to respond is not to retaliate with new or higher tariffs, but to end the state subsidies and unilaterally reduce tariffs. Instead, the UK has been dragged into a tariff war not of our making. These are the UK’s tariff proposals for when we leave the EU. They are substantially lower than the EU’s. Thanks to Brexit, tariffs on US whiskey and bourbon will be reduced – they will be abolished. I expect Donald Trump to do the same for the Scotch malt whisky. Thank goodness we have a lifeboat.","– Mr President, free trade brings prosperity; it lifts all our boats. Protectionism through subsidies and tariffs is the enemy of free trade and prosperity.

Sua Santità Papa Francesco,N/A,"Signor Presidente, signore e signori Vice Presidenti, onorevoli eurodeputati, persone che lavorano a titoli diversi in quest'emiciclo, cari amici, vi ringrazio per l'invito a prendere la parola dinanzi a questa istituzione fondamentale della vita dell'Unione europea e per l'opportunità che mi offrite di rivolgermi, attraverso di voi, agli oltre cinquecento milioni di cittadini che rappresentate nei 28 Stati membri. Particolare gratitudine, desidero esprimere a Lei, Signor Presidente del Parlamento, per le cordiali parole di benvenuto che mi ha rivolto, a nome di tutti i componenti dell'Assemblea. La mia visita avviene dopo oltre un quarto di secolo da quella compiuta da Papa Giovanni Paolo II. Molto è cambiato da quei giorni in Europa e in tutto il mondo. Non esistono più i blocchi contrapposti che allora dividevano il continente in due e si sta lentamente compiendo il desiderio che «l'Europa, dandosi sovranamente libere istituzioni, possa un giorno estendersi alle dimensioni che le sono state date dalla geografia e più ancora dalla storia». Accanto a un'Unione europea più ampia, vi è anche un mondo più complesso e fortemente in movimento. Un mondo sempre più interconnesso e globale e perciò sempre meno ""eurocentrico"". A un'Unione più estesa, più influente, sembra però affiancarsi l'immagine di un'Europa un po' invecchiata e compressa, che tende a sentirsi meno protagonista in un contesto che la guarda spesso con distacco, diffidenza e talvolta con sospetto.  Nel rivolgermi a voi quest'oggi, a partire dalla mia vocazione di pastore, desidero indirizzare a tutti i cittadini europei un messaggio di speranza e di incoraggiamento. Un messaggio di speranza basato sulla fiducia che le difficoltà possano diventare promotrici potenti di unità, per vincere tutte le paure che l'Europa - insieme a tutto il mondo - sta attraversando. Speranza nel Signore che trasforma il male in bene e la morte in vita.  Incoraggiamento di tornare alla ferma convinzione dei Padri fondatori dell'Unione europea, i quali desideravano un futuro basato sulla capacità di lavorare insieme per superare le divisioni e per favorire la pace e la comunione fra tutti i popoli del continente. Al centro di questo ambizioso progetto politico vi era la fiducia nell'uomo, non tanto in quanto cittadino, né in quanto soggetto economico, ma nell'uomo in quanto persona dotata di una dignità trascendente. Mi preme anzitutto sottolineare lo stretto legame che esiste fra queste due parole: ""dignità"" e ""trascendente"".  La ""dignità"" è la parola-chiave che ha caratterizzato la ripresa del secondo dopo guerra. La nostra storia recente si contraddistingue per l'indubbia centralità della promozione della dignità umana contro le molteplici violenze e discriminazioni, che neppure in Europa sono mancate nel corso dei secoli. La percezione dell'importanza dei diritti umani nasce proprio come esito di un lungo cammino, fatto anche di molteplici sofferenze e sacrifici, che ha contribuito a formare la coscienza della preziosità, unicità e irripetibilità di ogni singola persona umana. Tale consapevolezza culturale trova fondamento non solo negli avvenimenti della storia, ma soprattutto nel pensiero europeo, contraddistinto da un ricco incontro, le cui numerose fonti lontane provengono «dalla Grecia e da Roma, da substrati celtici, germanici e slavi, e dal cristianesimo che li ha plasmati profondamente», dando luogo proprio al concetto di ""persona"". Oggi, la promozione dei diritti umani occupa un ruolo centrale nell'impegno dell'Unione europea in ordine a favorire la dignità della persona, sia al suo interno che nei rapporti con gli altri paesi. Si tratta di un impegno importante e ammirevole, poiché persistono fin troppe situazioni in cui gli esseri umani sono trattati come oggetti, dei quali si può programmare la concezione, la configurazione e l'utilità, e che poi possono essere buttati via quando non servono più, perché diventati deboli, malati o vecchi. Effettivamente quale dignità esiste quando manca la possibilità di esprimere liberamente il proprio pensiero o di professare senza costrizione la propria fede religiosa? Quale dignità è possibile senza una cornice giuridica chiara, che limiti il dominio della forza e faccia prevalere la legge sulla tirannia del potere? Quale dignità può mai avere un uomo o una donna fatto oggetto di ogni genere di discriminazione? Quale dignità potrà mai trovare una persona che non ha il cibo o il minimo essenziale per vivere e, peggio ancora, che non ha il lavoro che la unge di dignità?  Promuovere la dignità della persona significa riconoscere che essa possiede diritti inalienabili di cui non può essere privata ad arbitrio di alcuno e tanto meno a beneficio di interessi economici.  Occorre però prestare attenzione per non cadere in alcuni equivoci che possono nascere da un fraintendimento del concetto di diritti umani e da un loro paradossale abuso. Vi è infatti oggi la tendenza verso una rivendicazione sempre più ampia di diritti individuali – sono tentato di dire individualistici – che cela una concezione di persona umana staccata da ogni contesto sociale e antropologico, quasi come una ""monade"" (μονάς), sempre più insensibile alle altre ""monadi"" intorno a sé. Al concetto di diritto non sembra più associato quello altrettanto essenziale e complementare di dovere, così che si finisce per affermare i diritti del singolo senza tenere conto che ogni essere umano è legato a un contesto sociale, in cui i suoi diritti e doveri sono connessi a quelli degli altri e al bene comune della società stessa. Ritengo perciò che sia quanto mai vitale approfondire oggi una cultura dei diritti umani che possa sapientemente legare la dimensione individuale, o, meglio, personale, a quella del bene comune, a quel ""noi-tutti"" formato da individui, famiglie e gruppi intermedi che si uniscono in comunità sociale. Infatti, se il diritto di ciascuno non è armonicamente ordinato al bene più grande, finisce per concepirsi senza limitazioni e dunque per diventare sorgente di conflitti e di violenze.  Parlare della dignità trascendente dell'uomo, significa dunque fare appello alla sua natura, alla sua innata capacità di distinguere il bene dal male, a quella ""bussola"" iscritta nei nostri cuori e che Dio ha impresso nell'universo creato; soprattutto significa guardare all'uomo non come a un assoluto, ma come a un essere relazionale. Una delle malattie che vedo più diffuse oggi in Europa è la solitudine, propria di chi è privo di legami. La si vede particolarmente negli anziani, spesso abbandonati al loro destino, come pure nei giovani privi di punti di riferimento e di opportunità per il futuro; la si vede nei numerosi poveri che popolano le nostre città; la si vede negli occhi smarriti dei migranti che sono venuti qui in cerca di un futuro migliore.  Tale solitudine è stata poi acuita dalla crisi economica, i cui effetti perdurano ancora con conseguenze drammatiche dal punto di vista sociale. Si può poi constatare che, nel corso degli ultimi anni, accanto al processo di allargamento dell'Unione europea, è andata crescendo la sfiducia da parte dei cittadini nei confronti di istituzioni ritenute distanti, impegnate a stabilire regole percepite come lontane dalla sensibilità dei singoli popoli, se non addirittura dannose. Da più parti si ricava un'impressione generale di stanchezza e d'invecchiamento, di un'Europa nonna e non più fertile e vivace. Per cui i grandi ideali che hanno ispirato l'Europa sembrano aver perso forza attrattiva, in favore dei tecnicismi burocratici delle sue istituzioni.  A ciò si associano alcuni stili di vita un po' egoisti, caratterizzati da un'opulenza ormai insostenibile e spesso indifferente nei confronti del mondo circostante, soprattutto dei più poveri. Si constata con rammarico un prevalere delle questioni tecniche ed economiche al centro del dibattito politico, a scapito di un autentico orientamento antropologico. L'essere umano rischia di essere ridotto a semplice ingranaggio di un meccanismo che lo tratta alla stregua di un bene di consumo da utilizzare, così che – lo notiamo purtroppo spesso – quando la vita non è funzionale a tale meccanismo viene scartata senza troppe remore, come nel caso dei malati, dei malati terminali, degli anziani abbandonati e senza cura, o dei bambini uccisi prima di nascere.  È il grande equivoco che avviene «quando prevale l'assolutizzazione della tecnica», che finisce per realizzare «una confusione fra fini e mezzi». Risultato inevitabile della ""cultura dello scarto"" e del ""consumismo esasperato"". Al contrario, affermare la dignità della persona significa riconoscere la preziosità della vita umana, che ci è donata gratuitamente e non può perciò essere oggetto di scambio o di smercio. Voi, nella vostra vocazione di parlamentari, siete chiamati anche a una missione grande benché possa sembrare inutile: prendervi cura della fragilità dei popoli e delle persone. Prendersi cura della fragilità dice forza e tenerezza, dice lotta e fecondità in mezzo a un modello funzionalista e privatista che conduce inesorabilmente alla ""cultura dello scarto"". Prendersi cura della fragilità delle persone e dei popoli significa custodire la memoria e la speranza; significa farsi carico del presente nella sua situazione più marginale e angosciante ed essere capaci di ungerlo di dignità. Come dunque ridare speranza al futuro, così che, a partire dalle giovani generazioni, si ritrovi la fiducia per perseguire il grande ideale di un'Europa unita e in pace, creativa e intraprendente, rispettosa dei diritti e consapevole dei propri doveri? Per rispondere a questa domanda, permettetemi di ricorrere a un'immagine. Uno dei più celebri affreschi di Raffaello che si trovano in Vaticano raffigura la cosiddetta Scuola di Atene. Al suo centro vi sono Platone e Aristotele. Il primo con il dito che punta verso l'alto, verso il mondo delle idee, potremmo dire verso il cielo; il secondo tende la mano in avanti, verso chi guarda, verso la terra, la realtà concreta. Mi pare un'immagine che ben descrive l'Europa e la sua storia, fatta del continuo incontro tra cielo e terra, dove il cielo indica l'apertura al trascendente, a Dio, che ha da sempre contraddistinto l'uomo europeo, e la terra rappresenta la sua capacità pratica e concreta di affrontare le situazioni e i problemi. Il futuro dell'Europa dipende dalla riscoperta del nesso vitale e inseparabile fra questi due elementi. Un'Europa che non è più capace di aprirsi alla dimensione trascendente della vita è un'Europa che lentamente rischia di perdere la propria anima e anche quello ""spirito umanistico"" che pure ama e difende.  Proprio a partire dalla necessità di un'apertura al trascendente, intendo affermare la centralità della persona umana, altrimenti in balia delle mode e dei poteri del momento. In questo senso ritengo fondamentale non solo il patrimonio che il cristianesimo ha lasciato nel passato alla formazione socioculturale del continente, bensì soprattutto il contributo che intende dare oggi e nel futuro alla sua crescita. Tale contributo non costituisce un pericolo per la laicità degli Stati e per l'indipendenza delle istituzioni dell'Unione, bensì un arricchimento. Ce lo indicano gli ideali che l'hanno formata fin dal principio, quali la pace, la sussidiarietà e la solidarietà reciproca, un umanesimo incentrato sul rispetto della dignità della persona. Desidero, perciò, rinnovare la disponibilità della Santa Sede e della Chiesa cattolica, attraverso la Commissione delle Conferenze episcopali europee, a intrattenere un dialogo proficuo, aperto e trasparente con le istituzioni dell'Unione europea. Parimenti sono convinto che un'Europa che sia in grado di fare tesoro delle proprie radici religiose, sapendone cogliere la ricchezza e le potenzialità, possa essere anche più facilmente immune dai tanti estremismi che dilagano nel mondo odierno, anche per il grande vuoto ideale a cui assistiamo nel cosiddetto Occidente, perché «è proprio l'oblio di Dio, e non la sua glorificazione, a generare la violenza».  Non possiamo qui non ricordare le numerose ingiustizie e persecuzioni che colpiscono quotidianamente le minoranze religiose, e particolarmente cristiane, in diverse parti del mondo. Comunità e persone che si trovano ad essere oggetto di barbare violenze: cacciate dalle proprie case e patrie; vendute come schiave; uccise, decapitate, crocefisse e bruciate vive, sotto il silenzio vergognoso e complice di tanti. Il motto dell'Unione europea è ""Unità nella diversità"", ma l'unità non significa uniformità politica, economica, culturale, o di pensiero. In realtà ogni autentica unità vive della ricchezza delle diversità che la compongono: come una famiglia, che è tanto più unita quanto più ciascuno dei suoi componenti può essere fino in fondo sé stesso senza timore. In tal senso, ritengo che l'Europa sia una famiglia di popoli, i quali potranno sentire vicine le istituzioni dell'Unione se esse sapranno sapientemente coniugare l'ideale dell'unità cui si anela, alla diversità propria di ciascuno, valorizzando le singole tradizioni; prendendo coscienza delle sua storia e delle sue radici; liberandosi dalle tante manipolazioni e dalle tante fobie. Mettere al centro la persona umana significa anzitutto lasciare che essa esprima liberamente il proprio volto e la propria creatività, sia a livello di singolo che di popolo.  D'altra parte le peculiarità di ciascuno costituiscono un'autentica ricchezza nella misura in cui sono messe al servizio di tutti. Occorre ricordare sempre l'architettura propria dell'Unione europea, basata sui principi di solidarietà e sussidiarietà, così che prevalga l'aiuto vicendevole e si possa camminare, animati da reciproca fiducia. In questa dinamica di unità-particolarità, si pone a voi, signori e signore eurodeputati, anche l'esigenza di farvi carico di mantenere viva la democrazia dei popoli dell'Europa. Non ci è nascosto che una concezione omologante della globalità colpisce la vitalità del sistema democratico depotenziando il ricco contrasto, fecondo e costruttivo, delle organizzazioni e dei partiti politici tra di loro. Così si corre il rischio di vivere nel regno dell'idea, della sola parola, dell'immagine, del sofisma… e di finire per confondere la realtà della democrazia con un nuovo nominalismo politico. Mantenere viva la democrazia in Europa richiede di evitare tante ""maniere globalizzanti"" di diluire la realtà: i purismi angelici, i totalitarismi del relativo, i fondamentalismi astorici, gli eticismi senza bontà, gli intellettualismi senza sapienza. Mantenere viva la realtà delle democrazie è una sfida di questo momento storico, evitando che la loro forza reale – forza politica espressiva dei popoli – sia rimossa davanti alla pressione di interessi multinazionali non universali, che le indeboliscano e le trasformino in sistemi uniformanti di potere finanziario al servizio di imperi sconosciuti. Questa è una sfida che oggi la storia vi pone. Dare speranza all'Europa non significa solo riconoscere la centralità della persona umana, ma implica anche favorirne le doti. Si tratta perciò di investire su di essa e sugli ambiti in cui i suoi talenti si formano e portano frutto. Il primo ambito è sicuramente quello dell'educazione, a partire dalla famiglia, cellula fondamentale ed elemento prezioso di ogni società. La famiglia unita, fertile e indissolubile porta con sé gli elementi fondamentali per dare speranza al futuro. Senza tale solidità si finisce per costruire sulla sabbia, con gravi conseguenze sociali. D'altra parte, sottolineare l'importanza della famiglia non solo aiuta a dare prospettive e speranza alle nuove generazioni, ma anche ai numerosi anziani, spesso costretti a vivere in condizioni di solitudine e di abbandono perché non c'è più il calore di un focolare domestico in grado di accompagnarli e di sostenerli. Accanto alla famiglia vi sono le istituzioni educative: scuole e università. L'educazione non può limitarsi a fornire un insieme di conoscenze tecniche, bensì deve favorire il più complesso processo di crescita della persona umana nella sua totalità. I giovani di oggi chiedono di poter avere una formazione adeguata e completa per guardare al futuro con speranza, piuttosto che con disillusione. Numerose sono, poi, le potenzialità creative dell'Europa in vari campi della ricerca scientifica, alcuni dei quali non ancora del tutto esplorati. Basti pensare ad esempio alle fonti alternative di energia, il cui sviluppo gioverebbe molto alla difesa dell'ambiente.  L'Europa è sempre stata in prima linea in un lodevole impegno a favore dell'ecologia. Questa nostra terra ha infatti bisogno di continue cure e attenzioni e ciascuno ha una personale responsabilità nel custodire il creato, prezioso dono che Dio ha messo nelle mani degli uomini. Ciò significa da un lato che la natura è a nostra disposizione, ne possiamo godere e fare buon uso; dall'altro però significa che non ne siamo i padroni. Custodi, ma non padroni. La dobbiamo perciò amare e rispettare, mentre «invece siamo spesso guidati dalla superbia del dominare, del possedere, del manipolare, dello sfruttare; non la ""custodiamo"", non la rispettiamo, non la consideriamo come un dono gratuito di cui avere cura». Rispettare l'ambiente significa però non solo limitarsi ad evitare di deturparlo, ma anche di utilizzarlo per il bene. Penso soprattutto al settore agricolo, chiamato a dare sostegno e nutrimento all'uomo. Non si può tollerare che milioni di persone nel mondo muoiano di fame, mentre tonnellate di derrate alimentari vengono scartate ogni giorno dalle nostre tavole. Inoltre, rispettare la natura, ci ricorda che l'uomo stesso è parte fondamentale di essa. Accanto ad un'ecologia ambientale, serve perciò quell'ecologia umana, fatta del rispetto della persona, che ho inteso richiamare quest'oggi rivolgendomi a voi. Il secondo ambito in cui fioriscono i talenti della persona umana è il lavoro. È tempo di favorire le politiche di occupazione, ma soprattutto è necessario ridare dignità al lavoro, garantendo anche adeguate condizioni per il suo svolgimento. Ciò implica, da un lato, reperire nuovi modi per coniugare la flessibilità del mercato con le necessità di stabilità e certezza delle prospettive lavorative, indispensabili per lo sviluppo umano dei lavoratori; d'altra parte, significa favorire un adeguato contesto sociale, che non punti allo sfruttamento delle persone, ma a garantire, attraverso il lavoro, la possibilità di costruire una famiglia e di educare i figli.  Parimenti, è necessario affrontare insieme la questione migratoria. Non si può tollerare che il Mar Mediterraneo diventi un grande cimitero! Sui barconi che giungono quotidianamente sulle coste europee ci sono uomini e donne che necessitano di accoglienza e di aiuto. L'assenza di un sostegno reciproco all'interno dell'Unione europea rischia di incentivare soluzioni particolaristiche al problema, che non tengono conto della dignità umana degli immigrati, favorendo il lavoro schiavo e continue tensioni sociali. L'Europa sarà in grado di far fronte alle problematiche connesse all'immigrazione se saprà proporre con chiarezza la propria identità culturale e mettere in atto legislazioni adeguate che sappiano allo stesso tempo tutelare i diritti dei cittadini europei e garantire l'accoglienza dei migranti; se saprà adottare politiche corrette, coraggiose e concrete che aiutino i loro paesi di origine nello sviluppo socio-politico e nel superamento dei conflitti interni – causa principale di tale fenomeno – invece delle politiche di interesse che aumentano e alimentano tali conflitti. È necessario agire sulle cause e non solo sugli effetti. Signor Presidente, Eccellenze, signore e signori deputati, la coscienza della propria identità è necessaria anche per dialogare in modo propositivo con gli Stati che hanno chiesto di entrare a far parte dell'Unione in futuro. Penso soprattutto a quelli dell'area balcanica per i quali l'ingresso nell'Unione europea potrà rispondere all'ideale della pace in una regione che ha grandemente sofferto per i conflitti del passato. Infine, la coscienza della propria identità è indispensabile nei rapporti con gli altri paesi vicini, particolarmente con quelli che si affacciano sul Mediterraneo, molti dei quali soffrono a causa di conflitti interni e per la pressione del fondamentalismo religioso e del terrorismo internazionale. A voi legislatori spetta il compito di custodire e far crescere l'identità europea, affinché i cittadini ritrovino fiducia nelle istituzioni dell'Unione e nel progetto di pace e amicizia che ne è il fondamento. Sapendo che «quanto più cresce la potenza degli uomini tanto più si estende e si allarga la loro responsabilità personale e collettiva». Vi esorto perciò a lavorare perché l'Europa riscopra la sua anima buona.  Un anonimo autore del II secolo scrisse che «i cristiani rappresentano nel mondo ciò che l'anima è nel corpo». Il compito dell'anima è quello di sostenere il corpo, di esserne la coscienza e la memoria storica. E una storia bimillenaria lega l'Europa e il cristianesimo. Una storia non priva di conflitti e di errori, anche di peccati, ma sempre animata dal desiderio di costruire per il bene. Lo vediamo nella bellezza delle nostre città, e più ancora in quella delle molteplici opere di carità e di edificazione umana comune che sostengono il continente. Questa storia, in gran parte, è ancora da scrivere. Essa è il nostro presente e anche il nostro futuro. Essa è la nostra identità. E l'Europa ha fortemente bisogno di riscoprire il suo volto per crescere, secondo lo spirito dei suoi Padri fondatori, nella pace e nella concordia, poiché essa stessa non è ancora esente dai conflitti. Cari eurodeputati, è giunta l'ora di costruire insieme l'Europa che ruota non intorno all'economia, ma intorno alla sacralità della persona umana, dei valori inalienabili; l'Europa che abbraccia con coraggio il suo passato e guarda con fiducia il suo futuro per vivere pienamente e con speranza il suo presente. È giunto il momento di abbandonare l'idea di un'Europa impaurita e piegata su sé stessa per suscitare e promuovere l'Europa protagonista, portatrice di scienza, di arte, di musica, di valori umani e anche di fede. L'Europa che contempla il cielo e persegue degli ideali; l'Europa che guarda, difende e tutela l'uomo; l'Europa che cammina sulla terra sicura e salda, prezioso punto di riferimento per tutta l'umanità!

A un'Unione più estesa, più influente, sembra però affiancarsi l'immagine di un'Europa un po' invecchiata e compressa, che tende a sentirsi meno protagonista in un contesto che la guarda spesso con distacco, diffidenza e talvolta con sospetto. Nel rivolgermi a voi quest'oggi, a partire dalla mia vocazione di pastore, desidero indirizzare a tutti i cittadini europei un messaggio di speranza e di incoraggiamento. Un messaggio di speranza basato sulla fiducia che le difficoltà possano diventare promotrici potenti di unità, per vincere tutte le paure che l'Europa - insieme a tutto il mondo - sta attraversando. Speranza nel Signore che trasforma il male in bene e la morte in vita. Incoraggiamento di tornare alla ferma convinzione dei Padri fondatori dell'Unione europea, i quali desideravano un futuro basato sulla capacità di lavorare insieme per superare le divisioni e per favorire la pace e la comunione fra tutti i popoli del continente. Al centro di questo ambizioso progetto politico vi era la fiducia nell'uomo, non tanto in quanto cittadino, né in quanto soggetto economico, ma nell'uomo in quanto persona dotata di una dignità trascendente. Mi preme anzitutto sottolineare lo stretto legame che esiste fra queste due parole: ""dignità"" e ""trascendente"". La ""dignità"" è la parola-chiave che ha caratterizzato la ripresa del secondo dopo guerra. La nostra storia recente si contraddistingue per l'indubbia centralità della promozione della dignità umana contro le molteplici violenze e discriminazioni, che neppure in Europa sono mancate nel corso dei secoli. La percezione dell'importanza dei diritti umani nasce proprio come esito di un lungo cammino, fatto anche di molteplici sofferenze e sacrifici, che ha contribuito a formare la coscienza della preziosità, unicità e irripetibilità di ogni singola persona umana. Tale consapevolezza culturale trova fondamento non solo negli avvenimenti della storia, ma soprattutto nel pensiero europeo, contraddistinto da un ricco incontro, le cui numerose fonti lontane provengono «dalla Grecia e da Roma, da substrati celtici, germanici e slavi, e dal cristianesimo che li ha plasmati profondamente», dando luogo proprio al concetto di ""persona"". Oggi, la promozione dei diritti umani occupa un ruolo centrale nell'impegno dell'Unione europea in ordine a favorire la dignità della persona, sia al suo interno che nei rapporti con gli altri paesi. Si tratta di un impegno importante e ammirevole, poiché persistono fin troppe situazioni in cui gli esseri umani sono trattati come oggetti, dei quali si può programmare la concezione, la configurazione e l'utilità, e che poi possono essere buttati via quando non servono più, perché diventati deboli, malati o vecchi. Effettivamente quale dignità esiste quando manca la possibilità di esprimere liberamente il proprio pensiero o di professare senza costrizione la propria fede religiosa? Quale dignità è possibile senza una cornice giuridica chiara, che limiti il dominio della forza e faccia prevalere la legge sulla tirannia del potere? Quale dignità può mai avere un uomo o una donna fatto oggetto di ogni genere di discriminazione? Quale dignità potrà mai trovare una persona che non ha il cibo o il minimo essenziale per vivere e, peggio ancora, che non ha il lavoro che la unge di dignità? Promuovere la dignità della persona significa riconoscere che essa possiede diritti inalienabili di cui non può essere privata ad arbitrio di alcuno e tanto meno a beneficio di interessi economici. Occorre però prestare attenzione per non cadere in alcuni equivoci che possono nascere da un fraintendimento del concetto di diritti umani e da un loro paradossale abuso. Vi è infatti oggi la tendenza verso una rivendicazione sempre più ampia di diritti individuali – sono tentato di dire individualistici – che cela una concezione di persona umana staccata da ogni contesto sociale e antropologico, quasi come una ""monade"" , sempre più insensibile alle altre ""monadi"" intorno a sé. Al concetto di diritto non sembra più associato quello altrettanto essenziale e complementare di dovere, così che si finisce per affermare i diritti del singolo senza tenere conto che ogni essere umano è legato a un contesto sociale, in cui i suoi diritti e doveri sono connessi a quelli degli altri e al bene comune della società stessa. Ritengo perciò che sia quanto mai vitale approfondire oggi una cultura dei diritti umani che possa sapientemente legare la dimensione individuale, o, meglio, personale, a quella del bene comune, a quel ""noi-tutti"" formato da individui, famiglie e gruppi intermedi che si uniscono in comunità sociale. Infatti, se il diritto di ciascuno non è armonicamente ordinato al bene più grande, finisce per concepirsi senza limitazioni e dunque per diventare sorgente di conflitti e di violenze. Parlare della dignità trascendente dell'uomo, significa dunque fare appello alla sua natura, alla sua innata capacità di distinguere il bene dal male, a quella ""bussola"" iscritta nei nostri cuori e che Dio ha impresso nell'universo creato; soprattutto significa guardare all'uomo non come a un assoluto, ma come a un essere relazionale. Una delle malattie che vedo più diffuse oggi in Europa è la solitudine, propria di chi è privo di legami. La si vede particolarmente negli anziani, spesso abbandonati al loro destino, come pure nei giovani privi di punti di riferimento e di opportunità per il futuro; la si vede nei numerosi poveri che popolano le nostre città; la si vede negli occhi smarriti dei migranti che sono venuti qui in cerca di un futuro migliore. Tale solitudine è stata poi acuita dalla crisi economica, i cui effetti perdurano ancora con conseguenze drammatiche dal punto di vista sociale. Si può poi constatare che, nel corso degli ultimi anni, accanto al processo di allargamento dell'Unione europea, è andata crescendo la sfiducia da parte dei cittadini nei confronti di istituzioni ritenute distanti, impegnate a stabilire regole percepite come lontane dalla sensibilità dei singoli popoli, se non addirittura dannose. Da più parti si ricava un'impressione generale di stanchezza e d'invecchiamento, di un'Europa nonna e non più fertile e vivace. Per cui i grandi ideali che hanno ispirato l'Europa sembrano aver perso forza attrattiva, in favore dei tecnicismi burocratici delle sue istituzioni. A ciò si associano alcuni stili di vita un po' egoisti, caratterizzati da un'opulenza ormai insostenibile e spesso indifferente nei confronti del mondo circostante, soprattutto dei più poveri. Si constata con rammarico un prevalere delle questioni tecniche ed economiche al centro del dibattito politico, a scapito di un autentico orientamento antropologico. L'essere umano rischia di essere ridotto a semplice ingranaggio di un meccanismo che lo tratta alla stregua di un bene di consumo da utilizzare, così che – lo notiamo purtroppo spesso – quando la vita non è funzionale a tale meccanismo viene scartata senza troppe remore, come nel caso dei malati, dei malati terminali, degli anziani abbandonati e senza cura, o dei bambini uccisi prima di nascere. È il grande equivoco che avviene «quando prevale l'assolutizzazione della tecnica», che finisce per realizzare «una confusione fra fini e mezzi». Risultato inevitabile della ""cultura dello scarto"" e del ""consumismo esasperato"". Al contrario, affermare la dignità della persona significa riconoscere la preziosità della vita umana, che ci è donata gratuitamente e non può perciò essere oggetto di scambio o di smercio. Voi, nella vostra vocazione di parlamentari, siete chiamati anche a una missione grande benché possa sembrare inutile: prendervi cura della fragilità dei popoli e delle persone. Prendersi cura della fragilità dice forza e tenerezza, dice lotta e fecondità in mezzo a un modello funzionalista e privatista che conduce inesorabilmente alla ""cultura dello scarto"". Prendersi cura della fragilità delle persone e dei popoli significa custodire la memoria e la speranza; significa farsi carico del presente nella sua situazione più marginale e angosciante ed essere capaci di ungerlo di dignità. Come dunque ridare speranza al futuro, così che, a partire dalle giovani generazioni, si ritrovi la fiducia per perseguire il grande ideale di un'Europa unita e in pace, creativa e intraprendente, rispettosa dei diritti e consapevole dei propri doveri? Per rispondere a questa domanda, permettetemi di ricorrere a un'immagine. Uno dei più celebri affreschi di Raffaello che si trovano in Vaticano raffigura la cosiddetta Scuola di Atene. Al suo centro vi sono Platone e Aristotele. Il primo con il dito che punta verso l'alto, verso il mondo delle idee, potremmo dire verso il cielo; il secondo tende la mano in avanti, verso chi guarda, verso la terra, la realtà concreta. Mi pare un'immagine che ben descrive l'Europa e la sua storia, fatta del continuo incontro tra cielo e terra, dove il cielo indica l'apertura al trascendente, a Dio, che ha da sempre contraddistinto l'uomo europeo, e la terra rappresenta la sua capacità pratica e concreta di affrontare le situazioni e i problemi. Il futuro dell'Europa dipende dalla riscoperta del nesso vitale e inseparabile fra questi due elementi. Un'Europa che non è più capace di aprirsi alla dimensione trascendente della vita è un'Europa che lentamente rischia di perdere la propria anima e anche quello ""spirito umanistico"" che pure ama e difende. Proprio a partire dalla necessità di un'apertura al trascendente, intendo affermare la centralità della persona umana, altrimenti in balia delle mode e dei poteri del momento. In questo senso ritengo fondamentale non solo il patrimonio che il cristianesimo ha lasciato nel passato alla formazione socioculturale del continente, bensì soprattutto il contributo che intende dare oggi e nel futuro alla sua crescita. Tale contributo non costituisce un pericolo per la laicità degli Stati e per l'indipendenza delle istituzioni dell'Unione, bensì un arricchimento. Ce lo indicano gli ideali che l'hanno formata fin dal principio, quali la pace, la sussidiarietà e la solidarietà reciproca, un umanesimo incentrato sul rispetto della dignità della persona. Desidero, perciò, rinnovare la disponibilità della Santa Sede e della Chiesa cattolica, attraverso la Commissione delle Conferenze episcopali europee, a intrattenere un dialogo proficuo, aperto e trasparente con le istituzioni dell'Unione europea. Parimenti sono convinto che un'Europa che sia in grado di fare tesoro delle proprie radici religiose, sapendone cogliere la ricchezza e le potenzialità, possa essere anche più facilmente immune dai tanti estremismi che dilagano nel mondo odierno, anche per il grande vuoto ideale a cui assistiamo nel cosiddetto Occidente, perché «è proprio l'oblio di Dio, e non la sua glorificazione, a generare la violenza». Non possiamo qui non ricordare le numerose ingiustizie e persecuzioni che colpiscono quotidianamente le minoranze religiose, e particolarmente cristiane, in diverse parti del mondo. Comunità e persone che si trovano ad essere oggetto di barbare violenze: cacciate dalle proprie case e patrie; vendute come schiave; uccise, decapitate, crocefisse e bruciate vive, sotto il silenzio vergognoso e complice di tanti. Il motto dell'Unione europea è ""Unità nella diversità"", ma l'unità non significa uniformità politica, economica, culturale, o di pensiero. In realtà ogni autentica unità vive della ricchezza delle diversità che la compongono: come una famiglia, che è tanto più unita quanto più ciascuno dei suoi componenti può essere fino in fondo sé stesso senza timore. In tal senso, ritengo che l'Europa sia una famiglia di popoli, i quali potranno sentire vicine le istituzioni dell'Unione se esse sapranno sapientemente coniugare l'ideale dell'unità cui si anela, alla diversità propria di ciascuno, valorizzando le singole tradizioni; prendendo coscienza delle sua storia e delle sue radici; liberandosi dalle tante manipolazioni e dalle tante fobie. Mettere al centro la persona umana significa anzitutto lasciare che essa esprima liberamente il proprio volto e la propria creatività, sia a livello di singolo che di popolo. D'altra parte le peculiarità di ciascuno costituiscono un'autentica ricchezza nella misura in cui sono messe al servizio di tutti. Occorre ricordare sempre l'architettura propria dell'Unione europea, basata sui principi di solidarietà e sussidiarietà, così che prevalga l'aiuto vicendevole e si possa camminare, animati da reciproca fiducia. In questa dinamica di unità-particolarità, si pone a voi, signori e signore eurodeputati, anche l'esigenza di farvi carico di mantenere viva la democrazia dei popoli dell'Europa. Non ci è nascosto che una concezione omologante della globalità colpisce la vitalità del sistema democratico depotenziando il ricco contrasto, fecondo e costruttivo, delle organizzazioni e dei partiti politici tra di loro. Così si corre il rischio di vivere nel regno dell'idea, della sola parola, dell'immagine, del sofisma… e di finire per confondere la realtà della democrazia con un nuovo nominalismo politico. Mantenere viva la democrazia in Europa richiede di evitare tante ""maniere globalizzanti"" di diluire la realtà: i purismi angelici, i totalitarismi del relativo, i fondamentalismi astorici, gli eticismi senza bontà, gli intellettualismi senza sapienza. Mantenere viva la realtà delle democrazie è una sfida di questo momento storico, evitando che la loro forza reale – forza politica espressiva dei popoli – sia rimossa davanti alla pressione di interessi multinazionali non universali, che le indeboliscano e le trasformino in sistemi uniformanti di potere finanziario al servizio di imperi sconosciuti. Questa è una sfida che oggi la storia vi pone. Dare speranza all'Europa non significa solo riconoscere la centralità della persona umana, ma implica anche favorirne le doti. Si tratta perciò di investire su di essa e sugli ambiti in cui i suoi talenti si formano e portano frutto. Il primo ambito è sicuramente quello dell'educazione, a partire dalla famiglia, cellula fondamentale ed elemento prezioso di ogni società. La famiglia unita, fertile e indissolubile porta con sé gli elementi fondamentali per dare speranza al futuro. Senza tale solidità si finisce per costruire sulla sabbia, con gravi conseguenze sociali. D'altra parte, sottolineare l'importanza della famiglia non solo aiuta a dare prospettive e speranza alle nuove generazioni, ma anche ai numerosi anziani, spesso costretti a vivere in condizioni di solitudine e di abbandono perché non c'è più il calore di un focolare domestico in grado di accompagnarli e di sostenerli. Accanto alla famiglia vi sono le istituzioni educative: scuole e università. L'educazione non può limitarsi a fornire un insieme di conoscenze tecniche, bensì deve favorire il più complesso processo di crescita della persona umana nella sua totalità. I giovani di oggi chiedono di poter avere una formazione adeguata e completa per guardare al futuro con speranza, piuttosto che con disillusione. Numerose sono, poi, le potenzialità creative dell'Europa in vari campi della ricerca scientifica, alcuni dei quali non ancora del tutto esplorati. Basti pensare ad esempio alle fonti alternative di energia, il cui sviluppo gioverebbe molto alla difesa dell'ambiente. L'Europa è sempre stata in prima linea in un lodevole impegno a favore dell'ecologia. Questa nostra terra ha infatti bisogno di continue cure e attenzioni e ciascuno ha una personale responsabilità nel custodire il creato, prezioso dono che Dio ha messo nelle mani degli uomini. Ciò significa da un lato che la natura è a nostra disposizione, ne possiamo godere e fare buon uso; dall'altro però significa che non ne siamo i padroni. Custodi, ma non padroni. La dobbiamo perciò amare e rispettare, mentre «invece siamo spesso guidati dalla superbia del dominare, del possedere, del manipolare, dello sfruttare; non la ""custodiamo"", non la rispettiamo, non la consideriamo come un dono gratuito di cui avere cura». Rispettare l'ambiente significa però non solo limitarsi ad evitare di deturparlo, ma anche di utilizzarlo per il bene. Penso soprattutto al settore agricolo, chiamato a dare sostegno e nutrimento all'uomo. Non si può tollerare che milioni di persone nel mondo muoiano di fame, mentre tonnellate di derrate alimentari vengono scartate ogni giorno dalle nostre tavole. Inoltre, rispettare la natura, ci ricorda che l'uomo stesso è parte fondamentale di essa. Accanto ad un'ecologia ambientale, serve perciò quell'ecologia umana, fatta del rispetto della persona, che ho inteso richiamare quest'oggi rivolgendomi a voi. Il secondo ambito in cui fioriscono i talenti della persona umana è il lavoro. È tempo di favorire le politiche di occupazione, ma soprattutto è necessario ridare dignità al lavoro, garantendo anche adeguate condizioni per il suo svolgimento. Ciò implica, da un lato, reperire nuovi modi per coniugare la flessibilità del mercato con le necessità di stabilità e certezza delle prospettive lavorative, indispensabili per lo sviluppo umano dei lavoratori; d'altra parte, significa favorire un adeguato contesto sociale, che non punti allo sfruttamento delle persone, ma a garantire, attraverso il lavoro, la possibilità di costruire una famiglia e di educare i figli. Parimenti, è necessario affrontare insieme la questione migratoria. Non si può tollerare che il Mar Mediterraneo diventi un grande cimitero! Sui barconi che giungono quotidianamente sulle coste europee ci sono uomini e donne che necessitano di accoglienza e di aiuto. L'assenza di un sostegno reciproco all'interno dell'Unione europea rischia di incentivare soluzioni particolaristiche al problema, che non tengono conto della dignità umana degli immigrati, favorendo il lavoro schiavo e continue tensioni sociali. L'Europa sarà in grado di far fronte alle problematiche connesse all'immigrazione se saprà proporre con chiarezza la propria identità culturale e mettere in atto legislazioni adeguate che sappiano allo stesso tempo tutelare i diritti dei cittadini europei e garantire l'accoglienza dei migranti; se saprà adottare politiche corrette, coraggiose e concrete che aiutino i loro paesi di origine nello sviluppo socio-politico e nel superamento dei conflitti interni – causa principale di tale fenomeno – invece delle politiche di interesse che aumentano e alimentano tali conflitti. È necessario agire sulle cause e non solo sugli effetti. Signor Presidente, Eccellenze, signore e signori deputati, la coscienza della propria identità è necessaria anche per dialogare in modo propositivo con gli Stati che hanno chiesto di entrare a far parte dell'Unione in futuro. Penso soprattutto a quelli dell'area balcanica per i quali l'ingresso nell'Unione europea potrà rispondere all'ideale della pace in una regione che ha grandemente sofferto per i conflitti del passato. Infine, la coscienza della propria identità è indispensabile nei rapporti con gli altri paesi vicini, particolarmente con quelli che si affacciano sul Mediterraneo, molti dei quali soffrono a causa di conflitti interni e per la pressione del fondamentalismo religioso e del terrorismo internazionale. A voi legislatori spetta il compito di custodire e far crescere l'identità europea, affinché i cittadini ritrovino fiducia nelle istituzioni dell'Unione e nel progetto di pace e amicizia che ne è il fondamento. Sapendo che «quanto più cresce la potenza degli uomini tanto più si estende e si allarga la loro responsabilità personale e collettiva». Vi esorto perciò a lavorare perché l'Europa riscopra la sua anima buona. Un anonimo autore del II secolo scrisse che «i cristiani rappresentano nel mondo ciò che l'anima è nel corpo». Il compito dell'anima è quello di sostenere il corpo, di esserne la coscienza e la memoria storica. E una storia bimillenaria lega l'Europa e il cristianesimo. Una storia non priva di conflitti e di errori, anche di peccati, ma sempre animata dal desiderio di costruire per il bene. Lo vediamo nella bellezza delle nostre città, e più ancora in quella delle molteplici opere di carità e di edificazione umana comune che sostengono il continente. Questa storia, in gran parte, è ancora da scrivere. Essa è il nostro presente e anche il nostro futuro. Essa è la nostra identità. E l'Europa ha fortemente bisogno di riscoprire il suo volto per crescere, secondo lo spirito dei suoi Padri fondatori, nella pace e nella concordia, poiché essa stessa non è ancora esente dai conflitti. Cari eurodeputati, è giunta l'ora di costruire insieme l'Europa che ruota non intorno all'economia, ma intorno alla sacralità della persona umana, dei valori inalienabili; l'Europa che abbraccia con coraggio il suo passato e guarda con fiducia il suo futuro per vivere pienamente e con speranza il suo presente. È giunto il momento di abbandonare l'idea di un'Europa impaurita e piegata su sé stessa per suscitare e promuovere l'Europa protagonista, portatrice di scienza, di arte, di musica, di valori umani e anche di fede. L'Europa che contempla il cielo e persegue degli ideali; l'Europa che guarda, difende e tutela l'uomo; l'Europa che cammina sulla terra sicura e salda, prezioso punto di riferimento per tutta l'umanità! Grazie.","Signor Presidente, signore e signori Vice Presidenti, onorevoli eurodeputati, persone che lavorano a titoli diversi in quest'emiciclo, cari amici, vi ringrazio per l'invito a prendere la parola dinanzi a questa istituzione fondamentale della vita dell'Unione europea e per l'opportunità che mi offrite di rivolgermi, attraverso di voi, agli oltre cinquecento milioni di cittadini che rappresentate nei 28 Stati membri.

Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL  in writing,N/A," I voted against this report because it authorises the exploration of shale gas in Europe in order to meet our energy demand. Shale gas is extracted using the hydraulic fracturing technique, which involves injecting a mixture of water, sand and other corrosive chemicals to create fractures in the rocks that contain this gas. This extraction method has harmful effects on the environment: groundwater contamination, emission of toxic gases, and even earthquakes. Authorising this type of extraction means, once again, allowing the commercial interests of the large energy companies to take priority over the European environment. Europe’s energy future requires a policy that priorities the environmental sustainability of the supply. That means that we need to make progress on renewable energies rather than extending non-renewable energy sources that are merely temporary patches with disastrous repercussions for the environment.

Căutarea unui loc de muncă pentru tineri a devenit astăzi un motiv de luptă psihologică. Lupta pentru un loc de muncă în rândul tinerilor a devenit deja un motiv de rasism. Lipsa locurilor de muncă produce o decădere a noii generații. Trebuie să susținem orice inițiativă a cetățenilor sau a instituțiilor, europene sau naționale, care creează locuri de muncă pentru tineri.","Chiar dacă discuțiile asupra inițiativei privind ocuparea forței de muncă în rândul tinerilor au demonstrat clar existența unor divergențe între statele membre, consider că abordarea acestei probleme la nivel european este binevenită și trebuie încurajată. Știm cu toții că șomajul în rândul tinerilor crește zilnic. Cererile de pe piață sunt uneori ridicole, cerându-li-se experiență de muncă tinerilor abia ieșiți de pe băncile instituțiilor de învățământ. Problema imigrației în rândul tinerilor -",nan
Daniel Buda,PPE," – Doamna președintă, domnule comisar, doamnelor și domnilor colegi, suntem cu toții conștienți că politica de coeziune reprezintă principalul instrument aflat la dispoziția regiunilor din întreaga Uniune Europeană în vederea înlăturării disparităților dintre acestea. Din păcate, în ultimii doi ani de zile, asistăm la provocări majore, care, pur și simplu, mușcă din coeziunea economică și socială a regiunilor, ca urmare a unor provocări pe care le resimțim cu toții; fie că vorbim de criza energetică, pandemia de COVID-19, inflația sau războiul din Ucraina, efectele sunt mai mult decât vizibile.  În acest context, regiunile sunt în mod diferit afectate. Unele au fost mai pregătite să facă față provocărilor amintite mai sus, iar altele nu. Statele membre au reușit cu greu să gestioneze aceste situații, inclusiv prin acordarea ajutoarelor de minimis în diverse sectoare. După cum bine știm, acest ajutor este, însă, limitat la valori care, în opinia mea, trebuie să fie revizuite. Este nevoie să creștem aceste praguri astfel încât statele membre să poată interveni în mod eficient și, bineînțeles, diferențiat.  Politica de coeziune și politica agricolă comună sunt indestructibil legate una de cealaltă. Așadar, aș dori să subliniez aici provocările cu care se confruntă IMM-urile, mai ales din mediul rural și în special din țările aflate în proximitatea Ucrainei. Realitatea de astăzi, generată de fluxurile comerciale fără taxe vamale din Ucraina, creează dificultăți majore multor sectoare economice în regiunile de graniță. Ajutoarele de minimis de care acestea au nevoie trebuie să fie corect dimensionate, adaptate nevoilor și, evident, într-un cuantum mult mai mare decât în prezent. În caz contrar, fenomenul depopulării acestor zone va fi unul și mai accelerat, iar acest lucru trebuie să fie evitat.

Vera Tax,S&D," – Voorzitter, wat fijn dat de heer Gieseke al weet wat wij gaan doen als sociaaldemocraten. Het is altijd prettig om te weten dat u daar ook heel erg in geïnteresseerd bent. Mobiliteit is belangrijk voor ons allemaal. Zo kunnen we naar het werk, naar onze familie en naar onze vrienden, naar alles wat belangrijk is in ons leven. Maar veel mensen kunnen niet volledig deelnemen aan de samenleving. Belangrijk is het structurele gebrek aan vervoersmiddelen, maar ook de beperkte toegankelijkheid van het openbaar vervoer voor mindervaliden, oudere mensen. En inderdaad, tel daarbij op de hoge kosten van het vervoer: 13 % van het huishouden gaat er gemiddeld naar de kosten van vervoer. Voor COVID was dat nog meer dan wat we in de EU gemiddeld uitgaven aan eten en drinken. Dit is dus een probleem waar we goed op moeten letten. Nu we beginnen met de Green Deal, met daarin een grote rol voor het vergroenen van de vervoersector, is het dus belangrijk dat we de mens centraal stellen. Niet de auto, maar de mensen die in die auto rijden. Alle mensen in de EU hebben recht op toegankelijk en betaalbaar vervoer.","– Voorzitter, wat fijn dat de heer Gieseke al weet wat wij gaan doen als sociaaldemocraten.

Jutta Paulus,Greens/EFA," – Herr Präsident! Auch ich bin der Meinung, dass es sehr wichtig ist, dieses Zeichen zu setzen und den Notfall auszurufen. Ich bin allerdings nicht der Meinung, dass es damit getan ist – da muss ich Herrn Lins ausnahmsweise mal zustimmen –, sondern dass es auch konkreter Maßnahmen bedarf. Deswegen, Herr Lins, werde ich aufpassen, ob Sie am Donnerstag für unsere grüne Entschließung stimmen, in der wir genau diese Maßnahmen aufführen, derer es jetzt bedarf. Danke für den Hinweis. Die gute Nachricht ist ja tatsächlich: Die erneuerbaren Energien sind inzwischen so kostengünstig geworden, dass wir als Europäische Union geradezu dumm wären, wenn wir uns weiterhin an die fossilen Energien ketten würden. Denn für die erneuerbaren Energien braucht es Investitionen, während die fossilen einfach nur immer weiter Kosten verursachen werden. Und da rede ich noch nicht mal von den Umweltkosten, sondern einfach nur von den Betriebskosten. Es hat ja seinen Grund, dass beispielsweise in Indien mittlerweile die Kohlekraftwerke, die im Bau sein sollten, aus der Reihe genommen werden und nicht gebaut werden. Es hat ja seinen Grund, dass China in seinem nächsten Fünfjahresplan so viel weniger fossile Energie vorsieht. Lasst uns diese Chance nicht verpassen! Aber wir müssen wirklich sagen, was diese Situation ist: Es ist eine Notsituation. Deswegen bitte ich Sie, unserer Entschließung zuzustimmen.

Necesitamos muchos hombres feministas para avanzar en nuestro objetivo de la igualdad de género y somos conscientes de las presiones y los insultos que se han recibido en esta Cámara. Y esos insultos y esas presiones y esas amenazas nos dan más razones que nunca para seguir trabajando y para no permitir que a las mujeres se nos pretenda dejar en etapas oscuras de la historia. Con la salud de las mujeres no se juega. Prohibir la educación sexual y el uso de los anticonceptivos va a suponer un aumento de los embarazos no deseados.

Van a verse en situaciones sin recursos económicos en las que se las quiere relegar a un segundo término. Es inadmisible que en pleno siglo XXI mueran mujeres en Europa y en el mundo por esta causa. La semana pasada tuvimos que escuchar a algunos dirigentes de la derecha decir que esto del aborto es cosa de la izquierda, que queremos eliminar lo que nos sobra. ¡Es una vergüenza escuchar esto! Una vergüenza y una falta de respeto a tantas mujeres que se han visto abocadas a tener que abortar porque no podían afrontar la situación a la que se veían abocadas. Tengamos más respeto hacia las mujeres. No es digno de ninguna causa acosar a los parlamentarios con imágenes terribles y argumentos falsos.

Franc Bogovič,PPE,"v imenu skupine PPE. – Gospa predsedujoča, spoštovana komisarka, cenjena poročevalka, veseli me, da lahko obravnavamo dolgoročno vizijo razvoja podeželja.  Vizijo, s katero pravzaprav zaokrožujemo cilje, ki smo jih vse od leta 2016 že zapisali tudi v koncept pametnih vasi, se pravi rešiti problem depopulacije, na eni strani odhajanja mladih s podeželja, po drugi strani staranja ljudi.  Prav tako pa zagotoviti vso potrebno infrastrukturo, vključno s širokopasovnimi povezavami, ki so se pokazale predvsem v covidu kot neobhodne tudi na podeželju, da bo podeželje omogočilo možnosti za nova delovna mesta, hkrati pa tudi za kvalitetno življenje.  Kmetijstvo je osnovna dejavnost. Tudi tu so potrebni novi prijemi v okviru preciznega kmetijstva. Kmetijstvo je pokazalo, da je odporno tudi v času covida.

Benoît Lutgen,PPE,"par écrit. – Monsieur le Président, Madame la rapporteure, chers collègues, merci pour ce rapport et votre travail de consultation dans ce cadre. L’objectif de sécurité poursuivi par le système de gestion du trafic doit rester une priorité des états membres, dans la mise en oeuvre de l’ERTMS.  Au même titre, l’amélioration du confort et de l’interopérabilité pour les passagers doit animer la suite de son application, pour rendre le train toujours plus attractif. Enfin, l’amélioration de la cadence et des délais de livraison du fret ferroviaire soutiendra aussi la crédibilité du secteur, face au transport routier ou aérien.  Pour soutenir un déploiement digne du 21ème siècle, je pense que les fonctionnalités offertes par les satellites et singulièrement le système Galileo doivent, dans le futur, être privilégiées. Moins couteux qu’une balise physique, le développement du positionnement satellite au service de la mobilité ferroviaire renforcerait encore sa crédibilité sur le plan international.  Des moyens pour la recherche doivent être consacrés à une mise en oeuvre rapide, sur les lignes principales et partout en Europe.

In this particular case, we are consolidating the regulations from 1999, two regulations from 2004 and one regulation from 2005.

Alfred Sant,S&D,"on behalf of the S&D Group. – Mr President, two years of work are being concluded, and thanks go to our rapporteur, Mr Kelleher.  DORA will now set common rules for cybersecurity protocols and for good behaviour for all financial services in the EU. It aims to ensure that all companies which manage our finances have the tools by which to withstand all types of ICT-related disruptions and operational threats.  For the financial sector, cyber—risks are being countered by performance and procedural requirements, and not only, as up to now, by regulatory guidelines defining how much funds to attach to cybersecurity. The latter is a moving target. As complex cyber—threats develop, new risks will emerge. As new technologies become part of the financial system, new opportunities will emerge as well. DORA should create a common market in financial security with harmonised ICT risk-management tools, testing procedures and testing reporting methods. From the beginning, proportionality was essential to our approach, clarifying the definitions of ICT incidents and critical functions to avoid adding unnecessary heaviness. DORA will now carry several challenges. Until now, big data and the cloud have been regulated from a data perspective. They will henceforth be strictly treated as extensions of financial entities if they provide critical services. Banks and financial services rely, in fact, on a few cloud service providers. The oversight over the latter must be rigorous. When the structure of the subsidiary changes, cloud providers will have to inform the supervisory authority. This ensures that DORA is enforced without restriction on geographical location.  Still, while we must deploy DORA with maximum commitment, European financial institutions need to be able to access all possible new technologies available globally as well as outside European borders. Clearly, this constitutes – and will constitute – a considerable new workload for supervisors.  Regarding the input impact of DORA on SMEs, although proportionality is embedded in DORA, in reality SMEs interfacing with banks and financial services could need stringent levels of cybersecurity compliance as they might otherwise pose a risk. The greatest care must be taken in this measure to avoid crippling SMEs.","on behalf of the S&D Group. – Mr President, two years of work are being concluded, and thanks go to our rapporteur, Mr Kelleher.

Ангел Джамбазки,ECR,"Поздравявам първо инициативата от страна на докладчика и бих искал да обсъдя предложените от него теми за дебат. И така, Договорът от Лисабон укрепва ролята на Парламента в сключването на международни споразумения, осигурявайки по-общо прилагане на процедурите за одобрение и подобрена информираност на Парламента по време на процеса, който води до сключване на споразумение. Това е по силата на член 218, параграф 10 от Договора за функционирането на Европейския съюз.  Съдебната практика на Съда на Европейския съюз ясно показва, че правото на Парламента да бъде информиран не се ограничава с исканията за информация, отправени от Парламента, а задължава институциите да поемат инициативата. Доста често обаче, на практика мнението на Парламента не се взема при сключването на международни споразумения и това според нас от групата на Европейските консерватори и реформисти е скандално незачитане на правата на пряко избрания орган, а именно Парламента.  Последният такъв случай е споразумението с Турция относно миграцията, с цялата условност на думата „споразумение“. Сигурен съм, че всички присъстващи днес тук колеги, колкото и да не са многобройни, сме наясно с фактите около това споразумение, но въпреки това бих искал отново да припомня, че според официалните изявления на 18 март тази година членовете на Европейския съвет и Република Турция, все още Република Турция, подписаха съвместна декларация за сътрудничество в областта на миграцията, която декларация формално е необвързващ документ, който предвижда обаче точни взаимни ангажименти на страните от политическа и бюджетна гледна точка.  Тук, при това т.нар. споразумение, става въпрос за това, че това е скрито международно споразумение, което според член 218, алинея 6 от Договора за Европейския съюз е трябвало да бъде сключено едва след изрично одобрение от Европейския парламент. Това, уважаеми колеги, означава, че проектът за споразумение с Турция трябваше да бъде обсъден тук в тази зала, да бъде представен на дебати. Първо, европейските представители да решат дали да има такова споразумение, след което да обсъдят конкретните текстове по това споразумение, а не да бъдат поставени чисто и просто в ролята на свидетел, на изслушващ на една PR акция, която направи Европейската комисия, Съветът на Европа и хората, които не са избирани, но претендират да бъдат европейски лидери. Всички сме наясно, че подобно одобрение за въпросното споразумение не е давано. Никой от нас не е декларирал, делегирал права на Европейската комисия и на Съвета да сключва подобни PR-ски споразумения.  Темата бе повдигната за обсъждане в комисията по правни въпроси от колеги от друга политическа група, като в дискусията взеха участие по наше настояване и представители на Правната служба на Европейския парламент. Те изразиха становища, че сключеното споразумение, т.нар. споразумение, няма правна обвързваща стойност, което обаче отказват да изразят писмено. Това е много странно. Казват, че има споразумение, но то няма правна стойност, това е някакво PR съобщение.  Само по себе си това твърдение е скандално. Скандално е, защото признава нещо, което отдавна всички ние, европейските представители, подозирахме, а именно, че самообявилите се, но неизбрани лидери на Европейския съюз правят, меко казано, срамни и скандални сделки зад гърба на европейските данъкоплатци. Съгласяват се да платят рекет, откуп в размер на милиарди евро – пари от джоба на всеки европеец – на един откровен диктатор, какъвто е турският президент Ердоган, за да ги спаси от това, което те сами си причиниха, а именно огромната криза, предизвикана от поканената от немския канцлер Меркел имигрантска вълна. Тази срамна и неевропейска сделка с един агресивен, арогантен и опасен диктатор, какъвто без съмнение е сегашният турски президент Ердоган, потъпква всички т.нар. европейски ценности. За нас няма нищо по-срамно от това да говориш за свободата на словото и да се привеждаш угоднически пред един диктатор, какъвто без съмнение е Ердоган, който всеки ден доказва на практика, по телевизора, на живо, как се смазва свободата на словото, как се превземат редакции, как се затварят медии, как се съдят журналисти, как се стреля по журналисти в съдебна зала, когато те, тези журналисти, разкриват една отвратителна истина.  За да не съм голословен, ще дам пример с атентата срещу редактора на вестник „Джумхуриет“ – това е турски вестник, а неговият редактор е човекът, който разкри простичкия, ясен и очакван от всички факт, че финансирането, въоръжаването, лекуването, обучаването на бойците на „Ислямска държава“ е от страна на Република Турция. И затова му беше поискана доживотна присъда, а после беше стреляно по него в залата на съда. Друг пример – превземането на редакцията на най-големия турски опозиционен вестник в Турция, „Заман“.  Смятам, че примерите, които изредих, са нагледен пример за нуждата от информация относно подобни споразумения. Като съзаконодателен орган Парламентът трябва да бъде уведомяван за всички детайли и всички етапи по процедурите. Призовавам Комисията да спазва ангажиментите си. (Ораторът приема да отговори на въпрос, зададен чрез вдигане на синя карта (член 162, параграф 8 от Правилника за дейността)).","Поздравявам първо инициативата от страна на докладчика и бих искал да обсъдя предложените от него теми за дебат. И така, Договорът от Лисабон укрепва ролята на Парламента в сключването на международни споразумения, осигурявайки по-общо прилагане на процедурите за одобрение и подобрена информираност на Парламента по време на процеса, който води до сключване на споразумение. Това е по силата на член 218, параграф 10 от Договора за функционирането на Европейския съюз. Съдебната практика на Съда на Европейския съюз ясно показва, че правото на Парламента да бъде информиран не се ограничава с исканията за информация, отправени от Парламента, а задължава институциите да поемат инициативата. Доста често обаче, на практика мнението на Парламента не се взема при сключването на международни споразумения и това според нас от групата на Европейските консерватори и реформисти е скандално незачитане на правата на пряко избрания орган, а именно Парламента. Последният такъв случай е споразумението с Турция относно миграцията, с цялата условност на думата „споразумение“.

Jan-Christoph Oetjen,ALDE,"im Namen der Renew-Fraktion. – Frau Präsidentin, liebe Tanja Fajon, liebe Frau Kommissarin! Wir bringen heute zwei Fonds zur Unterstützung der Mitgliedstaaten in der Migrationspolitik auf den Weg.  Ich sage das bewusst so, dass wir das zur Unterstützung der Mitgliedstaaten tun, weil wir mit diesen Fonds auch die Lehren aus der Migrationskrise von 2015/16 ziehen. Wir haben – das hat die Kommissarin gerade schon gesagt – die Instrumente, die damals ad hoc eingesetzt wurden, jetzt verstetigt, und die Mitgliedstaaten genießen gleichzeitig Flexibilität bei der Nutzung dieser Fonds, was sehr wichtig ist. Wir stärken auch gerade die Staaten, die besonders viele Migranten erreichen, indem wir ihnen im Endeffekt höhere Zuwendungen ermöglichen.  Mit den Fonds unterstützen wir auf der einen Seite Integration derer, die kommen. Wir unterstützen das resettlement, das heißt, dass wir für diejenigen mit der größten Vulnerabilität legale Wege zu uns nach Europa schaffen. Aber gleichzeitig ermöglichen wir natürlich auch, durch den Fonds Rückführungen zu fördern. Insofern glaube ich, dass wir bei den Möglichkeiten, über die die Mitgliedstaaten verfügen, eine gute balance haben. Der zweite Fonds stärkt den Grenzschutz. Und es ist mir besonders wichtig, noch einmal deutlich zu sagen, dass es jetzt darum geht, dass die Mitgliedstaaten diese Mittel abrufen und auch nutzen. Denn das Ziel ist doch, dass wir in der Europäischen Union natürlich einen guten Außengrenzschutz haben, im Inneren der Europäischen Union aber eben über alle Freiheiten verfügen und keine Grenzen mehr haben. Insofern erwarte ich von den Mitgliedstaaten auch, dass sie die Mittel abrufen und dass sie dann aufhören, vom Schengen-Acquis abzuweichen, und auch alle bisherigen Grenzkontrollen innerhalb der Europäischen Union abbauen.  Und am Ende mein Appell an die Mitgliedstaaten: Hören Sie auf, in der Migrations- und Asylpolitik zu blockieren! Begeben Sie sich auf den Weg, dass Sie endlich konstruktiv mit uns daran arbeiten, dass wir ein gemeinsames europäisches funktionierendes Asyl- und Migrationssystem haben, das auf den Werten von Rechtsstaatlichkeit und Humanität basiert und das Solidarität mit allen Mitgliedstaaten beinhaltet, in denen viele Flüchtlinge ankommen.","im Namen der Renew-Fraktion. – Frau Präsidentin, liebe Tanja Fajon, liebe Frau Kommissarin!

Daniel Buda,PPE," – Doamna președintă, doamna comisar, doamnelor și domnilor colegi, salutăm preocupările cetățenilor legate de soarta sectorului apicol.  Potrivit FAO, din cele 100 de specii de culturi care furnizează 90% din produsele alimentare la nivel mondial, 71 de specii sunt polenizate de albine. Importanța protejării albinelor este, așadar, mai mult decât esențială pentru viitorul sectorului agricol, pentru fermieri, dar și pentru securitatea alimentară.  Datele furnizate de Comisia Europeană arată însă că în 2019 și în 2020 a fost înregistrată o creștere a numărului de stupi cu 5,1%, respectiv 7,6% la nivel european. Cea mai mare creștere a fost realizată în Spania, 10%, și în România, 8,5%.  Iată deci, stimați colegi, că poate exista o creștere a numărului de albine sau de familii de albine, chiar dacă folosim pesticide, cu condiția ca acestea să fie utilizate în mod rațional.  Propunerea aflată astăzi pe masa Parlamentului European vizează o reducere în etape a consumului de pesticide. Indiferent de procentele vehiculate, fie 30% sau 80%, acestea nu vor putea fi puse în practică în mod unitar, pentru simplul motiv că avem diferențe majore între statele membre în ceea ce privește consumul.  Astfel, România are un consum de 650 de grame pe hectar, iar Olanda consumă 7 900 de grame pe hectar. Nu ai cum să reduci acest procent în mod unitar la nivelul statelor membre.  În același timp, o reducere a cantității de pesticide, fără să existe studii serioase de impact sau alternative viabile pentru fermieri, va fi de natură să afecteze grav sectorul agricol, cât și albinele.

However, we also disagree with most of the justifications that the majority in Parliament are putting forward in order to prevent the 2011 budget from being adopted. The debate which has begun on the post-2013 financial perspectives is already flawed for a number of reasons, among them, the inability of the European institutions – Parliament and the Council – to come to an agreement in the negotiations on the 2011 budget; the attempts by several Member States to force a reduction in funds for future budgets; the insistence of others on new own resources for the EU, suggesting the creation of European taxes on top of national taxes, paid by the public rather than the financial sector; insistence on the full implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon; and opposition by rich countries to considerably increasing their contributions to the EU budget.

Cette pandémie ne doit pas être non plus un prétexte pour laisser libre cours aux lubies politiques de la technocratie.

Or, l’exposé des motifs de de ce texte est déroutant, on y indique que les données qui serviront à établir la distribution des fonds seront collectées et établies par des ONG dites spécialisées. Au-delà du fait que ces ONG s’arrogeraient des prérogatives des États, nombre d’entre elles sont très politisées et servent leur propre but idéologique avant tout. Cette pandémie ne doit pas être non plus un prétexte pour laisser libre cours aux lubies politiques de la technocratie. Qu’elle n’oublie pas que les pauvres qu’elle prétend aider aujourd’hui ont été plongés dans la détresse et le dénuement par leur propre politique: absence de frontière, accords de libre-échange, délocalisations, désindustrialisation. Voilà en fait le bilan de la politique mondialiste européenne.","au nom du groupe ID. – Madame la Présidente, mes chers collègues, cette pandémie est le catalyseur de ce qui sera, de ce qui est déjà une crise économique et sociale sans précédent, aggravée par la dramatique incurie des politiques européistes qui ont éliminé un à un les outils élémentaires de souveraineté.

Janusz Władysław Zemke ,S&D," Madam President, I would like to agree with the evaluation of the situation presented by Mrs Ashton. You are right, Mrs Ashton, that if we want to change the situation in Yemen, we need both humanitarian and, perhaps, military action. If this range of measures is to be a broad one, it also requires coordination, because it is not only the European Union which is responsible for improving the situation in Yemen. There are many such institutions. In relation to this, I would like to ask the following question: do you not think the work of the UN and the European Union on humanitarian issues should be better coordinated? In the area of military matters and reconnaissance, we also need better cooperation with NATO and intelligence services – I am thinking specifically about the intelligence services of particular countries. For these measures must be coordinated, because they would then be significantly more effective.","Madam President, I would like to agree with the evaluation of the situation presented by Mrs Ashton.

Georgios Stavrakakis,N/A,"Mr President, I should like to inform you that I will be making use of all my time. I was responsible for the discharge of the agencies, where the Committee on Budgetary Control has executed its task of exercising control over the administration of a significant number of decentralised agencies and joint undertakings. The successful execution of this important task would not be possible without the help and cooperation of my fellow shadow rapporteurs or the members of the committee, my office and the secretariat. I would like to thank them all for that. I would also like to very much thank Mr O’Shea from the Court of Auditors for his contribution and cooperation. I strongly believe that the European agencies and joint undertakings bring added value to the EU and help strengthen European identity with a presence in the Member States. At the same time, our role as a Parliament is accountability towards citizens, so we have to make sure that taxpayers’ money is used properly, transparently and effectively. The constructive dialogue involved a long monitoring process over several months between Parliament, the agencies, the Commission, the Internal Audit Service and the Court of Auditors. The joint long, analytical and preparatory work has resulted, in my opinion, in increasing transparency and tighter management discipline. Let me now turn to the two agencies for which our committee is proposing to postpone the discharge: CEPOL and EMEA. In CEPOL we were expecting to find problems dating back to last year’s report. Since the new Director has been in place the action plan that Parliament requested has been implemented and results are just now starting to be visible. I think that it is widely accepted that, since the new management took over, improvements in the running of` CEPOL have been evident. Nevertheless CEPOL needs to step up its efforts. In EMEA, the European Medicines Agency, problems were found with the management of procurement procedures. Concerns were raised about the potential risk to the independence of experts and also potential problems with staff recruitment. In general, EMEA is considered a well organised and functioning agency. Nevertheless, for an agency of this significance, I think that we should be absolutely sure that the right procedures are in place and effectively applied. For this reason we have requested the agency, with the cooperation of the Internal Audit Service, to conduct an audit and present us with the results by the end of June. Let me now conclude with a horizontal report. I would like to believe that this report gives a comprehensive overview of all the issues that are related to all the agencies and joint undertakings. The report identifies many examples of good practice and includes proposals for future improvements. It calls for a review of all agencies by the Commission, with particular attention to be paid to the smallest agencies and how their performance can be improved. It also calls on the Court of Auditors to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the agencies’ approach to the management of situations where there is a potential conflict of interests. I am very satisfied with the readiness of the Court to do so. In the current major economic and social crisis, the significance of monitoring has become more important than ever before. Together – Parliament, agencies, the Commission and the Court of Auditors – we are committed to dealing with and solving the problems and achieving even better results. It is exceptionally difficult to avoid irregularities but it is even more important to find them and to prevent them. I am of the opinion that we have successfully carried out this function of monitoring.","Mr President, I should like to inform you that I will be making use of all my time.

Janusz Wojciechowski,N/A," Członek Komisji. – Panie Przewodniczący! Odpowiem w języku polskim, w tym języku było najwięcej pytań i pełnych emocji wystąpień. Odniosę się może do poruszających słów pana posła Witolda Waszczykowskiego, który mówił o tym, że powinniśmy tu znaleźć rozwiązanie, które połączy interesy państwa kandydującego i państw członkowskich. Kandydującej Ukrainy i walczącej Ukrainy. A z drugiej strony tych, których mamy strzec w pierwszej kolejności – obywateli Unii Europejskiej, rolników Unii Europejskiej. I jestem przekonany, że takie rozwiązanie znaleźliśmy. Chciałem podziękować rządowi polskiemu, który pierwszy podjął inicjatywę, ale również rządom pozostałych państw, tzw. przyfrontowych, bo graniczących z Ukrainą – Rumunii, Bułgarii, Słowacji i Węgrom – za konstruktywną współpracę w tej sprawie. Dziesiątki godzin spędziliśmy dyskutując o tym, jakie znaleźć rozwiązanie w tej bardzo trudnej, nasilającej się kryzysowej sytuacji.  I znaleźliśmy takie rozwiązanie. To jest właśnie ten po raz pierwszy w historii Unii Europejskiej wprowadzony lokalny zakaz importu do pięciu państw. Bardzo trudno było to osiągnąć. Ale udało się do tego rozwiązania przekonać i od drugiego maja taki zakaz został wprowadzony. A potem, 5 czerwca, został przedłużony na kolejny okres. Bardzo trudno to było przeprowadzić. Dziękuję panu posłowi Halickiemu, że spowodował tę debatę dzisiaj, bo to na wniosek Pana Posła, ale szkoda, że nie wcześniej, bo nie czułem waszego wsparcia wtedy, kiedy trzeba było walczyć o wprowadzenie tego zakazu. Nie było niestety tego wsparcia, nie było pomocy.  Szanowni Państwo, znaleźliśmy rozwiązanie, które po pierwsze ustabilizowało rynek w tych krajach i po drugie, tak jak podawałem – 2 miliony 900 tysięcy ton przed zakazem z Ukrainy, 3 miliony 200 po wprowadzeniu zakazu. Korytarze solidarnościowe okazały się sukcesem. Przypomnę, że przed wojną, przed rosyjskim atakiem na Ukrainę 90% ukraińskiego ziarna było eksportowane przez Morze Czarne, również do Europy. Hiszpania, Holandia, Włochy to są kraje, które miliony ton ukraińskiego ziarna, głównie kukurydzy na potrzeby ich hodowli, importowały i importują nadal. To był eksport wykonywany kiedyś głównie drogą morską i trzeba było szybko w okresie wojny, kiedy Rosja zablokowała ukraińskie porty na Morzu Czarnym, zorganizować tę pomoc. I to zostało zorganizowane. 44 miliony ton korytarzami solidarnościowymi przez terytorium 5 państw, przez granice tych państw, przez drogi, kolejami tych państw. To jest ogromny sukces. Chciałem podziękować bardzo mocno tym krajom. Rumunii, bo przez nią szedł największy tranzyt, i nadal idzie największy. Ale dziękuję Polsce, dziękuję Węgrom, dziękuję Słowacji, dziękuję Bułgarii za to, że zorganizowały się tak sprawnie, bo to spadło na te kraje. Ten cały wysiłek.  Szanowni Państwo, jaką sytuację mamy dziś? Ukraina ma według obecnych prognoz na ten rok gospodarczy 2023–2024 do wyeksportowania 56 mln ton ziarna. Nawet prognozy wzrosły, wcześniej były niższe – 48, 49 mln ton. 56 mln ton oznacza średnio 4 miliony 700 tysięcy ton miesięcznie. Morze Czarne zablokowane i nikt nie wie, czy zostanie przez Rosję odblokowane. Wiemy jakie działania prowadzi Rosja w tym zakresie - kryminalne, a żywności używa jako broni. Ale jesteśmy w stanie te 4 miliony 700 tysięcy ton wyeksportować, pomóc Ukrainie w eksporcie drogą lądową, przez korytarze solidarnościowe. Już było blisko tej wielkości w listopadzie 2022 roku, kiedy eksport wyniósł 4 miliony 200 tysięcy ton. 3 miliony 200 ton to już ten poziom. Ten eksport jest dokonywany. I teraz trzeba tylko usprawnić, rozszerzyć te korytarze solidarnościowe. Obok głównego transportu – Rumunia już praktycznie nie jest go w stanie udźwignąć – trzeba tranzyt rozprowadzić przez Morze Bałtyckie, do portów bałtyckich – Litwa, Kłajpeda, Ryga na Łotwie, do portów Adriatyckich (wiem, że na przykład port w Rijece jest zdolny bardzo wspomóc ten tranzyt). Tylko trzeba ponieść koszty. I dlatego przedstawiam te propozycje i bardzo proszę o polityczne wsparcie. I wtedy, nawet jeśli Rosja będzie cały czas blokować porty czarnomorskie, ukraińskie albo niszczyć transporty ze zbożem, to co robi teraz, to jesteśmy w stanie skutecznie poprzez korytarze solidarnościowe zapewnić eksport i to właśnie do potrzebujących krajów. Jeśli to będzie tranzyt do portów morskich, to będzie pewność, że nie zostanie on w krajach członkowskich, tylko pojedzie dalej. Najbardziej racjonalny będzie eksport do tych regionów świata, które tego najbardziej potrzebują.  Szanowni Państwo, myślę, że argumentów za przedłużeniem tego zakazu jest aż nadto. Chciałem wykorzystać tę debatę. Wiem, że pewnie przysłuchuje się jej również strona ukraińska, nasi partnerzy, którzy jutro też usiądą do dyskusji w ramach tej platformy. Proszę, żeby bardzo poważnie rozważyli również swoje stanowisko w tej sprawie. Dzięki temu czasowemu zakazowi zwiększył się eksport. Ustał bardzo niedobry handel spekulacyjny, legalny, ale spekulacyjny, bazujący na różnicy cen. I ustabilizował się rynek w tych pięciu krajach.  Ceny oczywiście to jest odrębny problem, bo te kształtowane są przez rynki światowe. To nie jest bezpośredni wpływ importu z Ukrainy. Ale ten zalew w dużej skali ustał. I to jest bardzo ważne osiągnięcie. Nie należy tego psuć. Myślę, że Ukraina też powinna przemyśleć swoją postawę w tej sprawie, bo alternatywą jest powrót chaosu, czyli jednostronnych decyzji niektórych państw członkowskich, problemów z protestami, blokadami itd. To nie będzie dobre dla Ukrainy, absolutnie nie. Tym bardziej w sytuacji zablokowanego Morza Czarnego, zablokowanych portów ukraińskich.  Szanowni Państwo, jeszcze raz bardzo dziękuję za debatę. Szkoda, że niektórzy, którzy dzisiaj tutaj krytycznie się wypowiadali, nie byli obecni na debacie 31 sierpnia w Komisji Rolnictwa. Tam się głównie uciera polityczne stanowisko, panie pośle Halicki, właśnie w Komisji Rolnictwa. Szkoda, że nie było nikogo, ani Pana, ani Pańskich kolegów na tej debacie. Szkoda, bo może byśmy już dzisiaj nie musieli nawet dyskutować, bo może łatwiej byłoby podjąć decyzję.  Szanowni Państwo, przedstawiłem wszystkie argumenty, które przemawiają za tym, żeby to, co się udało osiągnąć Komisji, było kontynuowane, żeby ten czasowy zakaz był przedłużony, bo jest to zdecydowanie dobre i dla Unii Europejskiej i dla naszych rolników, dla rolników w tych 5 krajach członkowskich, i dobre dla Ukrainy.

Ruža Tomašić ,ECR,"Poštovani predsjedavajući, mislim da se ipak trebate više ograditi jer cijela Hrvatska, cijela Slovenija bruje o tome.

Paulo Rangel,PPE," – Mr President, I would like to say that, 10 years after the Lisbon Treaty, it is really time to prepare our Union for the next decade. We need a very, very deep and broad debate and discussion to prepare our institutions and to prepare our Union for the challenge of the future. This is the scope and the reason for organising this conference. What is really different is that this time, we want to use in the preparation all the skills and all the tools that we have available to engage citizens in this debate. This is our goal. But this is what we call participative democracy, this is true. But, be careful: we don’t want to mix participative democracy with representative democracy. One thing is to listen and to consult citizens, to engage them, to bring them committed to our debate. Another thing is institutional representation, with all the liberal heavy touch from our rule—of—law states and we should keep these two spheres very clearly separated, even if we have to engage in this project in a manner that we can use all the impulse that citizens will give us. So, my hope is that we can, for the first time, have a process of reform of the European Union where citizens are really heard and where their opinion matters.","– Mr President, I would like to say that, 10 years after the Lisbon Treaty, it is really time to prepare our Union for the next decade.

Evin Incir,S&D," – Madam President, democracy is under attack right now, both by internal forces in our Union as well as by foreign forces, and both offline and online. Offline we see Erdoğan and Turkish authorities spreading their tentacles into our Union in their aim to pursue dissidents, many times Kurdish dissidents. And Xi Jinping and Chinese authorities send threatening emails to EU journalists like the freelance journalist Jojje Olsson at the Swedish newspaper Expressen. Online we constantly see how Putin in Russia, but also Chinese authorities, spread fake news about the EU, elections in Member States and parties that are not pro-Putin. Even worse is that some of the foreign dictators link arms with their like-minded in the EU: Orbán in Hungary and Kaczyński in Poland.  I now ask Mr Borrell: how is the Commission ensuring that the policies that aim to combat foreign interference also lead to consequences for those EU government leaders who link arms with foreign leaders that attack our democracies?","– Madam President, democracy is under attack right now, both by internal forces in our Union as well as by foreign forces, and both offline and online.

Maria Arena,S&D," – Madame la Présidente, Monsieur le Commissaire, cher Didier, je vous propose un tour du monde express en matière de non-liberté de la presse. En Amérique latine, il y a eu une terrible augmentation de la répression des journalistes critiquant tant la corruption des gouvernements que les politiques inégalitaires en matière sociale ou environnementale. La région d’Asie Pacifique est la région la plus dangereuse pour les journalistes et les blogueurs. Nous avons eu l’occasion, dans la commission des droits de l’homme, d’accueillir Mme Ressa, fondatrice du site d’information Rappler aux Philippines, qui a été accusée de cyberdiffamation, juste pour avoir diffusé des informations. Au Vietnam, la situation n’est pas très claire non plus. Le blogueur Nguyen Trung ou encore le journaliste indépendant Pham Dung ont été arrêtés au moment même où nous ratifions l’accord commercial UE-Vietnam. En Afrique subsaharienne, là encore la liberté d’expression est mise à mal, comme au Nigeria, où il y a eu 115 cas d’abus envers des journalistes cette année. La situation au Moyen-Orient, avec l’assassinat de Khashoggi, ou encore en Afrique du Nord, avec l’arrestation de Khaled Drareni en Algérie, n’est pas très claire, n’est pas très réjouissante non plus. Au Bangladesh, plusieurs journalistes et blogueurs, comme Shahidul Alam, ont été emprisonnés et torturés, en vertu de la loi draconienne de 2018 sur la sécurité numérique.

Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,N/A,"Mr President, dear colleagues, thank you very much for your contributions to this debate. Mr Draghi, the ECB has rightly intervened and has prevented an even bigger disaster. The ECB has saved many Europeans from again experiencing massive bank runs. It seems that the financial markets do not trust the eurozone as an irreversible monetary union. However, the pressure of the financial markets can help force the most indebted countries to curb their budgets and to increase their competitiveness. The crisis is an opportunity for more fiscal union, to underpin monetary union. The old nation states have to lose a part of their fiscal sovereignty. The European crisis is also a political crisis. European citizens have discovered that the European Union does not have its own instruments to act against a huge crisis and that the European Union does not have its own resources to develop its own policies. The European Commission has been greatly weakened also by a lack of democratic legitimacy. Its President should be one of the Members of this Parliament. Mr Draghi, good luck with your work; more than ever, in the ECB we trust.","Mr President, dear colleagues, thank you very much for your contributions to this debate.

Siegfried Mureşan,PPE," – Madam President, the European Union will be spending in the next years more money than ever, from the budget of the European Union and from the Recovery and Resilience Facility. And the Recovery and Resilience Facility, together with the cohesion policy, are the most important investment policies that the European Union has, benefiting the net recipient countries, but in fact benefiting also the single market of the European Union, the economies in all of our Member States. We have decided the policy for the next 7 years with future—oriented objectives, objectives which will make our economies stronger, more competitive, more innovative. This is why we should, Commissioner, make sure that we are able to implement the policy without any further delay. My first call to the Commission is to make sure that you’re working with Member States to recover the delays. Yes, we had delays also in the adoption of the legal basis, but now the delays are in the adoption of the operational programmes of the partnership agreements. We have to work with governments. They concentrated and they did well on the Recovery and Resilience Facility, but we have to push them now as well because there have to be synergies between the two, because there needs to be coherence, convergence, coordination, and the Recovery and Resilience Facility will be more successful if implemented hand in hand with cohesion policy. First thing. Second thing. The fact that there is a delay now we should also use to make sure that we allocate money where countries need it, also as a consequence of the war in Ukraine. Exactly as we reacted when COVID occurred, we should see where we can introduce more flexibility, where we can eventually amend the co—financing rate so that Member States can use the money on the ground where it is needed, including to alleviate the consequences of increased energy prices and help the most vulnerable people affected by the increase of energy prices.","– Madam President, the European Union will be spending in the next years more money than ever, from the budget of the European Union and from the Recovery and Resilience Facility.

Neena Gill ,S&D,"Mr President, I echo the call from my colleagues that we urgently need to review the economic governance rules in the EU. The Commission communication is a small step but we need to go further. As an ultimate proof of failing austerity policies, the economic governance framework needs profound change, and as the European Parliament we have the legislative key.

Mick Wallace,GUE/NGL," – Madam President, when Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in April 2019, the democracy that the people were calling for was replaced by the continuation of military rule by two key members of Bashir’s regime: Burhan and Hemedti have been murdering pro-democracy protesters ever since. The opposition to Burhan and Hemedti is widespread, well organised, and their demands are clear: they want civilian rule and nothing to do with the military junta. But this didn’t stop the international community – mainly the UN, the US and UK – from supporting renewed talks between the junta and the right wing Forces for Freedom and Change coalition.  The West were happy to legitimise a de facto military dictatorship because this is the arrangement that has served our financial interests and the interests of the IMF and the World Bank for many years. The green light given to the military takeover is what led to the recent conflict, and they know that whoever comes out on top will be the next golden boy for the West.","– Madam President, when Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in April 2019, the democracy that the people were calling for was replaced by the continuation of military rule by two key members of Bashir’s regime: Burhan and Hemedti have been murdering pro-democracy protesters ever since.

Silvia-Adriana Ţicău ,S&D," Approximately 2 million passengers in the EU-27 use air transport every year, with 22% travelling domestically, 44% inside the EU and 34% outside the EU. The eruption of the volcano in Iceland has highlighted to us the weakness of the European transport system. During the last six days, more than 17 000 flights have been cancelled and millions of passengers have remained stuck in various locations, both inside and outside the EU. In these circumstances, the rapid provision of accurate information to passengers was an absolute must. Passenger safety must be our overriding concern. This is why, particularly within the European Union, there should be an efficient system for redirecting passengers to other forms of transport: rail, waterways or roads. If such a system had been in operation, 66% of passengers who were grounded during this period and those travelling within a Member State or the EU itself would have reached their destination using other means of transport. It is becoming absolutely vital to allocate the necessary funds for a trans-European transport network to be developed so that high-speed railway lines can serve not only all the Member States’ capitals but other large European cities as well. Another increasingly paramount aspect is the development of transport along inland waterways and of the European maritime corridors. Let us demonstrate political will and stick to our slogan: ‘Keep Europe moving!’.","Approximately 2 million passengers in the EU-27 use air transport every year, with 22% travelling domestically, 44% inside the EU and 34% outside the EU.

Licia Ronzulli ,PPE," Bananas are the world’s fourth most important crop and make a major contribution to global food security. Nevertheless, only 20% of production is traded internationally. The trade is concentrated in the hands of just five major multinationals, which alone control more than 80% of all internationally traded bananas. On 15 December 2009, the EU reached an agreement with the United States and a group of Latin American countries on a new tariff regime, bringing to a close a protracted dispute over the fact that African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries could export bananas to Europe under favourable tariffs, distorting the market to the detriment of South American producers. The agreement will make the global market in bananas more predictable and stable, and thereby encourage investment and growth in the sector. Parliament should now ensure that the Commission and the Council put forward specific initiatives to strengthen the commercial position of banana growers; they should provide Parliament as soon as possible with an impact assessment on the agreement’s effects on banana-producing developing countries and the outermost regions of the European Union. Finally, under no circumstances should we attempt to finance banana-producing ACP countries by reallocating funds from development cooperation.","Bananas are the world’s fourth most important crop and make a major contribution to global food security.

Karima Delli,Greens/EFA," Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sawicki, the number of poor and unemployed people in the European Union continues to rise. More than 43 million Europeans are threatened by food poverty. The situation is critical. Today, six Member States want to put an end to the food aid programme with no replacement solution: Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. Admittedly, the Court of Justice of the European Union has made a ruling and we have to respect it. Nevertheless, Commissioner, in June 2011, Parliament called on you, on the initiative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and you made appropriate proposals in order to protect the programme. The Verts/ALE Group is ready to work with you on long-term solutions; however, given that millions of people depend on this scheme, we cannot allow the food aid budget to be reduced by three-quarters. This is absolutely urgent. If nothing is done before the end of the year, the food banks will be lacking almost EUR 300 million, and there is no guarantee that the national governments will be able to step up to bridge that gap. This is therefore a real question of solidarity between people. We cannot allow a minority of irresponsible governments to deprive millions of Europeans of their food aid, because this is first and foremost a matter of survival. The fight against poverty and malnutrition also requires a reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). We need to make fundamental changes to our production methods in order to bring food production closer to the people, particularly the poorest, who also have a right to a healthy, balanced diet. Only a truly sustainable CAP can guarantee that fewer Europeans will need food aid in the future. The Council needs to see reason, and let those in need have recourse to this vital aid. I am addressing the future Danish Government in particular, who will be responsible for taking over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in January. They need to see reason. Will it take hunger riots in Europe in order for us to realise the urgent need to change our way of thinking? When it comes to saving the banks, the Council finds solutions, but when it is a matter of saving the food banks, nobody is interested. Parliament spoke some strong words last time, when we said that human beings are more important than finance. It is high time we reasserted that. In any case, Parliament will be extremely vigilant, and we will not hesitate to renew our call in a constructive manner.","Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sawicki, the number of poor and unemployed people in the European Union continues to rise.

Monika Hohlmeier ,PPE," My decision to vote against the interim SWIFT agreement is not a decision against cooperation with the USA on combating terrorism. I emphatically advocated that a new, compatible agreement that would allow European and US security authorities to work closely together and enable them to detect money transfers with suspected links to terrorism should be created as swiftly as possible. However, there are major flaws in the interim agreement, including inadequate provisions as regards data deletion, rights of complaint and access to information and onward transmission to third parties. Moreover, what I expect from a genuine partnership between the European Union and the USA is one which does not merely leave the responsibility for ensuring security of citizens within the framework of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP) in US hands, but which also provides a clearly defined time-frame for the development of a European TFTP, in partnership with the USA, within the European Union, as well. For this reason, I hope that an agreement will be negotiated, in the nearest future, which still provides a long-term basis for jointly combating terrorism worldwide, in terms of detecting terrorist networks and their financial transactions, but which respects citizens’ data privacy, as well.","My decision to vote against the interim SWIFT agreement is not a decision against cooperation with the USA on combating terrorism.

It follows that this mechanism will only acquire legitimacy if it is not used to target Member States in order to punish them. Secondly, the mechanism must be completely even-handed as between Member States. The slightest hint of different treatment will delegitimise it, so no cherry picking, no opportunistic targeting. This, of course, will require continuous monitoring. The third is consistency of implementation, but here a balance has to be struck between subsidiarity and all European practice.

Something which also needs to be understood is the perspective of Member States which are undertaking large infrastructural projects. Working out a sensible compromise between environment protection and infrastructure development is the need of the hour. Development must not take place to the detriment of nature.

President,N/A,"I am extremely pleased to be able to preside over our Parliament together with my female fellow Members. Six of them are Vice-Presidents of Parliament, two are Quaestors, and the Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is sitting next to me. This is a particular honour and privilege for me. I am resuming the sitting. The next item is the debate on the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day. We shall begin with a short film summarising the history of this notable day. Please start the projection. (Projection of a film) Dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, a film lasting two minutes cannot show everything that has happened over the past 100 years. We have, in fact, changed Europe in this time, and we Europeans can be proud when we compare Europe to many places in the world, but at the same time, we know that our journey is not over. There are still too few women in politics, and here in the European Parliament, our female Members account for only 35% of all Members. This figure is admittedly somewhat higher than in the national parliaments, but it is still not enough. Fortunately, the figure in our Parliament’s main decision-making bodies is well over 40%, and we are very pleased about this. This is also the case for the chairs of the committees. Yet the European Parliament’s formation in three years’ time, after the next elections, essentially depends on the national parliaments and the way in which representatives are appointed to the European Parliament. It is our national parliaments that must ensure that the number of women in the European Parliament increases. We are calling on them today to do so, and we are calling on our counterparts in the national parliaments to ensure that appropriate legal solutions are found and the appropriate decisions are taken to facilitate an increase in the number of women in the European Parliament. We can also set an example when it comes to the employment of women. Of those employed in the European Parliament, 59% are women and, at the same time, over 50% of these women deal with matters of substance. I have extensive experience in this area and can pride myself on the fact that while I was responsible for the government in my country, around 50 women occupied the highest ministerial positions and served as directors of the most important state offices. This record has never been broken, neither before nor in the dozen or so years since. As President of the European Parliament, I have also called for there to be more women in the European Commission and in high-level positions in the European Union. We can be pleased that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is a woman. The situation in European businesses has also changed, which is very beneficial not only for women, but, above all, for the way in which these businesses operate. We should also ensure that women and men employed in the same jobs with the same skills receive the same pay. We still have a lot to do in this respect. We are very well aware that women are also capable of fighting for democracy and human rights. I would like to pay tribute to all of our female fellow Members in the European Parliament, and to think at this point about the women in North Africa and in the Middle East who are showing true courage in their fight for democracy. Let us also remember that the past winners of the Sakharov Prize include magnificent women such as Aung San Suu Kyi, Leyla Zana and the Ladies in White. I should therefore like once again to repeat that we will not agree to depriving women of their dignity in the name of any legal system, religion or culture. We will not agree to women having fewer rights than men, in Europe or elsewhere in the world. We will protest if women are unfairly treated. Ladies and gentlemen, on 3 November 1793, 218 years ago, Olympia de Gouges was beheaded in Europe because she drafted a declaration of the rights of women and female citizens. That was the only reason. One hundred years later, in 1906, women were given the right to vote. The first country where this happened was Finland. Let us remember this. Over the following century, we made enormous progress in achieving equality between women and men. I would like to stress something which is very important for me personally, namely, that 8 March is a holiday for women. This is true. Yet this holiday primarily serves to remind us that we should remember the most important issue in Europe today, namely, equality of rights for women and men, during the remaining 364 days of the year. The principles we wish to reinforce on 8 March should also apply on the other 364 days in the year. This is the main challenge facing us. It is not enough merely to commemorate 8 March; we need to think about this matter on all the other days in the year as well. Thank you very much.","I am extremely pleased to be able to preside over our Parliament together with my female fellow Members. Six of them are Vice-Presidents of Parliament, two are Quaestors, and the Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is sitting next to me. This is a particular honour and privilege for me. I am resuming the sitting. The next item is the debate on the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day. We shall begin with a short film summarising the history of this notable day. Please start the projection. Dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, a film lasting two minutes cannot show everything that has happened over the past 100 years. We have, in fact, changed Europe in this time, and we Europeans can be proud when we compare Europe to many places in the world, but at the same time, we know that our journey is not over. There are still too few women in politics, and here in the European Parliament, our female Members account for only 35% of all Members. This figure is admittedly somewhat higher than in the national parliaments, but it is still not enough. Fortunately, the figure in our Parliament’s main decision-making bodies is well over 40%, and we are very pleased about this. This is also the case for the chairs of the committees. Yet the European Parliament’s formation in three years’ time, after the next elections, essentially depends on the national parliaments and the way in which representatives are appointed to the European Parliament. It is our national parliaments that must ensure that the number of women in the European Parliament increases. We are calling on them today to do so, and we are calling on our counterparts in the national parliaments to ensure that appropriate legal solutions are found and the appropriate decisions are taken to facilitate an increase in the number of women in the European Parliament. We can also set an example when it comes to the employment of women. Of those employed in the European Parliament, 59% are women and, at the same time, over 50% of these women deal with matters of substance. I have extensive experience in this area and can pride myself on the fact that while I was responsible for the government in my country, around 50 women occupied the highest ministerial positions and served as directors of the most important state offices. This record has never been broken, neither before nor in the dozen or so years since. As President of the European Parliament, I have also called for there to be more women in the European Commission and in high-level positions in the European Union. We can be pleased that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is a woman. The situation in European businesses has also changed, which is very beneficial not only for women, but, above all, for the way in which these businesses operate. We should also ensure that women and men employed in the same jobs with the same skills receive the same pay. We still have a lot to do in this respect. We are very well aware that women are also capable of fighting for democracy and human rights. I would like to pay tribute to all of our female fellow Members in the European Parliament, and to think at this point about the women in North Africa and in the Middle East who are showing true courage in their fight for democracy. Let us also remember that the past winners of the Sakharov Prize include magnificent women such as Aung San Suu Kyi, Leyla Zana and the Ladies in White. I should therefore like once again to repeat that we will not agree to depriving women of their dignity in the name of any legal system, religion or culture.

Luis Garicano,ALDE," – Mr President, I lived in the UK for a decade and my eldest son now lives there, and the difference between the freedoms that I enjoyed and the ones he will enjoy are stark. I enjoyed free movement. He can look forward to crossing borders, being in queues and paying for costly visas each time he travels. My generation enjoyed the Erasmus programme. His generation – and all other UK students – will not be allowed to travel around the continent and get to know other educational systems and other cultures. I enjoyed portable social security rights. He will not enjoy such rights. He, like another three million European citizens in the UK, has gone from being a citizen to an immigrant overnight, and the same is happening to 1.2 million UK diaspora Brits, who will be deprived of the right to citizenship and will have to endure nightmares of restricted working rights.  The UK Government wanted this and we accept it and we will vote for it, but it’s not a good deal, as no deal that curtails rights and limits the ability of people to move could be. I hope a new generation of British people will continue the struggle and, in due time, we will see the UK return to the European Union.

Julie Girling ,ECR,"Madam President, this really is a triumph of bad timing and insensitivity. At a time when European citizens are questioning in ever increasing numbers the effectiveness, relevance and, above all, the cost of the European Union, we are bringing forward proposals for an expensive extra level of pseudo-democracy. I strongly oppose such a proposal and see it as a perfect example of the increasing disconnect between some Members of this House and their electorate. Before Members vote for more MEPs, perhaps they should study the trends in opinion polls across Europe. These show rapidly declining support for the European project, and most particularly for this Parliament. If we want to reverse this trend we must find ways of reflecting the views of the citizens, challenging the Commission to bring forward relevant initiatives and demonstrating added value to Member States. It is not the case that we Conservatives do not have dreams. We do. We dream of a progressive Europe. It is just that those dreams lead us in a completely different direction. However, they are just as valid and, if you keep on in the direction that you are talking about, you are merely going to assist us in that task.","Madam President, this really is a triumph of bad timing and insensitivity.

José Manuel Fernandes ,PPE," An increasing number of natural disasters have been affecting the Member States of the EU, many of them on a large scale. It is notable that over the first six years of the EU Solidarity Fund, it has had 62 requests for financial support from 21 different countries. These natural disasters compromise biodiversity, affect sustainable development and put social cohesion at risk. Rural flight and desertification are among the causes of these disasters and, simultaneously, these processes are exacerbated by such disasters. Climate change will make natural disasters even worse. The solution covers prevention and support for the most vulnerable regions. This prevention must be part of a logic of cooperation and coordination at European level, and a strengthening of European solidarity. I am therefore advocating a suitable financial framework for disaster prevention. This framework must strengthen and encourage links between the current instruments and cohesion policy, rural development policy, regional policy, the Solidarity Fund, the Seventh Framework Programme and the Life+ programmes. The next financial perspectives must clearly reflect this goal. I would also argue that there is a need to review the Solidarity Fund regulations, adapting the eligibility criteria to the characteristics of each region and disaster.","An increasing number of natural disasters have been affecting the Member States of the EU, many of them on a large scale.

Katarina Barley,S&D,"on behalf of the S&D Group. – Mr President, the situation of the rule of law in Greece has been deteriorating in recent times, and I found the report by the Commissioner really alarming. I mean, her having to remind a government to secure physical safety of journalists. This should really silence any critics about the critics, you know. And the most obvious issue you see it is media freedom. In the 2022 World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, Greece marked the 108th country. And of course, the last country in Europe. And the most disturbing event probably was the murder of the investigative journalist Giorgos Karaivaz in April 2021. In almost two years, that has been close to no progress in the investigations. And in the last months, it turned out that at least 13 Greek journalists have been targeted by the spyware Predator. One of them covered the introduction of laws by the Mitsotakis government, impeding the prosecution of money laundering and other financial wrongdoing.  Now you have to know that Predator and Pegasus are not just spyware. It is as if someone had your mobile phone in their hands. They can manipulate everything you do on your phone. They can listen to everything you do. They can switch on the camera whenever they want to. This is a very serious breach of privacy rights. And within the Pegasus inquiry committee, we were shocked to learn about the large scale of political use of this spyware in Greece, besides the use against investigative journalists. Also the opposition leader Nikos Androulakis, Member of this parliament, and other politicians were spied upon.  And all of this, the use of this wide-ranging spying software without ex ante judicial authorisation, ex post oversight and meaningful legal remedy is a clear breach of our union's fundamental rights. But it is not this alone. Moreover, we discovered close ties between the government and the company Intelexa that is selling this spy software Predator. It is a script that could be written in any textbook on corruption. Until last summer, the nephew of the Prime Minister, Mitsotakis, was his secretary-general/head of cabinet in his office. He was responsible for government contacts with the national intelligence service. Moreover, two friends of this nephew, Bitzios and Lavranos, happened to be key figures in the supply for communications surveillance material and both benefited from lucrative government contracts. The nephew had to resign, as well as the director of the intelligence service.  Now, elections have been called in Greece. This makes it even more urgent to end the illegal spying on journalists, as well as on opposition politicians or politicians in general. Greece is the birthplace of democracy. The current situation is a disgrace for this beautiful country. This mess needs to be cleaned up and it needs to be cleaned up now.

Petras Auštrevičius,ALDE," –Madam Chair, Commissioner, dear colleagues, Ukrainian grain has been and continues to be a lifeline for many people in third countries increasingly facing food insecurity and hunger.

It is thus possible to simplify the procedures so that the national authorities can grant a single residence and work permit for legal immigrants, so that they can benefit from a set of rights similar to those of the workers in the Member State where they are living.

Iratxe García Pérez,S&D,"en nombre del Grupo S&D. – Señora presidenta, señora presidenta Von der Leyen, señor alto representante, señor ministro, en los últimos días el mundo ha vuelto a vivir un nuevo episodio de acciones temerarias e insensatas de Putin: la movilización militar rusa, los falsos referendos de anexión y una peligrosa retórica sobre el uso de armas nucleares. Pero, además, por primera vez, serios y preocupantes acontecimientos han ocurrido fuera de territorio ucraniano: me refiero al sabotaje de infraestructuras de energía en el Báltico. El mundo está siguiendo con temor y con preocupación esta escalada. También, la pasada semana, un convoy civil fue atacado por las fuerzas rusas cerca de Zaporiyia con víctimas mortales y heridos.  Señorías, más allá de la puesta en escena diaria de Putin, esta es la realidad de su maquinaria de guerra. Esta es una guerra ilegal y cruel contra la inocente población de Ucrania. Civiles que pierden sus vidas, civiles desplazados, civiles que han dejado sus casas huyendo de la atrocidad.  La anexión de la semana pasada de Putin es ilegítima y una violación clara de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas. Cambiar las fronteras de Ucrania por la fuerza y anexionar territorios que ni tan siquiera controla es pura propaganda. Estas acciones proyectan lo que Putin es: un hombre desesperado, cuyo liderazgo y autoridad está cada día más en duda.  Ante esta peligrosa escalada, debemos apoyar más a Ucrania y a su ciudadanía. Debemos reforzar nuestro apoyo para contener las acciones ilegales de Rusia y debemos aumentar la presión con sanciones adicionales para acabar con esta guerra. ¿Saben también para qué?

First of all, as an Austrian MEP, I would like to offer my truly heartfelt thanks for the fact that you paid a visit to Austria over the last two days and also engaged with the national parliamentarians, who have already had the opportunity to discuss this project. Secondly, I would like to offer Mr Reul’s excuses. This was his speaking time, but he had to go to committee, as we had several jobs to do at the same time. When it comes to today’s debate, first of all I want to say to the Council, yes, a solution was reached at this Council. Yet the Heads of State or Government lacked the courage to opt for a purely European solution. With such a solution, we would not have needed to involve the IMF. The criteria when it comes to money are clear. Yet we – Europe – must take action ourselves if we have problems within the European Union. We need more European solutions. My second point concerns Europe 2020. Europe 2020 is not an objective. It must be an instrument to achieve our objectives, including as a consequence of the economic and financial crisis. This Europe 2020 lacks the projects, the clear instruments and, at the moment, the political will to have these objectives become reality. My third point, Mr Van Rompuy, is that the Treaty of Lisbon is not enough, and that more intergovernmental collaboration is needed. However, we do not want intergovernmental collaboration based around President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel, without the European Parliament and without the citizens. What we have achieved with the Treaty of Lisbon must not be brushed aside, even when tackling future issues.","Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Van Rompuy, I have two preliminary remarks to make.

Anže Logar,N/A," President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the Recovery and Resilience Facility is at the heart of the EU response to the coronavirus virus crisis. It will play a central role in mitigating the economic and social impact of the pandemic and delivering a more sustainable and resilient European Union, better prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the Green and Digital Transition. Beyond its economic impact, the Facility is a strong sign of European unity and ambition. The unprecedented solidarity shown through the RRF requires everyone to use its funds responsibly and efficiently. The Facility also offers a unique opportunity to enhance investment coordination across the EU, and joint coordinated action at European level is more effective and benefits Member States more than uncoordinated individual national efforts, not least due to a significant spillover effect across countries.  The RRF, embedded in the European Semester of economic and employment policy coordination, will also become a key tool to implement the policy reform agenda in the years ahead. The reforms included in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan will be instrumental in effectively addressing the country-specific recommendations identified in the context of the European Semester. Hence, national parliaments will play a key role in the timely adoption of the legislative reforms to allow the full implementation of the plans.  A successful RRF requires not only the effective use of its funds, but also a sound and credible financial structure. I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has already raised over EUR 70 billion of Next Generation EU funds, and that it has attracted great interest among international investors. We have come a long way since the adoption of the Facility in February. All Member States, but one, have submitted their RRPs. The Commission has assessed 22 plans and the Council has acted swiftly on the related Commission proposals and adopted all 22 plans, with the tight timeline set out in the regulation.  The RRF has featured on the agendas of all the ECOFIN Councils during this presidency and three extraordinary informal Council meetings. They were also there to accelerate the adoption of the process.  The Council stands ready to examine, without delay, the proposals that the Commission will make for the pending RRPs and to ensure that they all meet the requirements for a positive assessment.  Overall, the plans approved by the Council so far represent EUR 291 billion in non-repayable financing and EUR 154 billion in loans. Member States have allocated almost 40% of spending in their plans to climate measures and more than 26% to the Digital Transition, exceeding the agreed targets of 37% and 20% respectively.  The adoption of the Council implementing decisions has allowed the disbursement since August 2021 of more than EUR 50 billion in pre—financing to 18 Member States, boosting recovery efforts across the Union.  With the approval of the Recovery and Resilience Plans and the first funds distributed to Member States, the focus now crucially turns to the implementation phase. Throughout this phase, checking and monitoring will be vital if the RRF, as a whole, is to be a lasting success. Member States have started to submit their payment requests for the implementation of their plans. Each request will require verification that the relevant milestones and targets are properly met. We, as the co-legislators, have no formal role in the assessment of these requests, which are carried out by the Commission in compliance with the regulation. For its part, the Council will continue to monitor the implementation of the Facility and, as appropriate, provide political impetus and guidance to unroll its full potential.  As I said, the implementation of the Recovery and Resilience Plans will be a key element of the economic surveillance and policy coordination in the context of the European Semester. The Council remains committed to continuing its close engagement with all interested parties at every step of the way to make the RRF a success.","President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the Recovery and Resilience Facility is at the heart of the EU response to the coronavirus virus crisis.

Isabella Tovaglieri,ID," – Signora Presidente, signor Commissario, onorevoli colleghi, la speculazione sui prezzi dell'energia sta letteralmente mettendo in ginocchio cittadini e imprese, ma purtroppo l'Europa non sembra rendersene conto. Oggi abbiamo insignito qui, al Parlamento europeo, il popolo ucraino del più alto riconoscimento europeo, appunto il Premio Sacharov, ma non ci rendiamo conto che se l'Europa non intraprenderà a breve azioni concrete ed immediate a favore dei cittadini europei, questo significherà rendere molto presto impopolare il sostegno che l'Europa sta accordando all'Ucraina. Non possiamo, infatti, continuamente chiedere sacrifici ai nostri cittadini, già piegati da due anni di pandemia, senza offrire loro delle soluzioni concrete per il contenimento della bolla speculativa e, soprattutto, prospettive di uscita dalla crisi energetica.

Nuno Melo ,PPE," The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that. This support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised world. An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers’ rights.  The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses, and it is crucial in facilitating their access to new employment in the future. The EGF has been used in the past by other EU countries, so it is now appropriate to provide aid to the Netherlands, which has submitted a request for assistance in respect of cases concerning 650 redundancies in 45 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Gelderland and Overijssel.","The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a part of that.

Evelyne Gebhardt,S&D," Mr President, I would first like to say that it is totally outrageous that there are no members of the Commission here, because this is a question directed at the European Commission. This shows contempt for Parliament. It is simply outrageous and we find it totally unacceptable. (Heckling) Yes? Yes, he did not get up. Well, I am sorry. I cannot accept that. Moving on to the matter in hand, ladies and gentlemen, this is all about the citizenship of the Union, about the people who have the right to move freely throughout the European Union and to practise their professions where they live and where they choose to work. We have put this legislation in place so that this will become easier and so that the process of recognising professional qualifications can genuinely be brought up to date. I find it simply appalling that the Member States in many cases have not taken the necessary steps to implement this legislation and to ensure that citizens really have this freedom of movement. There is still a great deal to be done by the European Commission in this respect. I would like to draw attention to one point which is very important to me and which we have repeatedly brought up in Parliament. We must ensure that the European professional card, which we have proposed, is introduced. This will put into citizens’ hands something that will allow them to move throughout Europe. There are organisations which are attempting to do this. However, I feel it is important to ask the European Commission whether this is an area in which it could become involved in order to speed this process up.","Mr President, I would first like to say that it is totally outrageous that there are no members of the Commission here, because this is a question directed at the European Commission.

Nicola Caputo ,S&D,"Benvenuto e in bocca al lupo signor Primo ministro. In questi sei mesi incombono sfide definitive con cui l'Unione Europea dovrà confrontarsi: immigrazione, terrorismo e Brexit in primis. Solo una maggiore cooperazione tra gli Stati membri offrirà la svolta necessaria nella gestione dei flussi migratori e dei rifugiati. La tenuta dell’area Schengen è a rischio e urge la prioritaria creazione di un'intelligence europea. È strategica la menzione che lei ha fatto ai giovani: un'Europa che voglia un futuro deve coltivarlo nella gioventù. La Presidenza incoraggi quindi lo sviluppo di un approccio globale per ridurre disoccupazione ed esclusione sociale tra i giovani. Va quindi sfidato e raggiunto l'obiettivo dell'innovazione e sostenibilità nel settore agricolo, nella semplificazione della PAC, che rientra tra le priorità di ogni Presidenza che voglia combattere lo spreco di cibo e voglia garantire la sicurezza alimentare. Va inoltre ricostruito il tessuto economico europeo delle PMI, sfruttando il loro coefficiente di resilienza rispetto a momenti di recessione come quelli attuali. La catena dei valori europei va quindi rinsaldata, contro ogni radicalizzazione e terrorismo, con più Europa, ma anche con un'Europa più vicina ai cittadini. Il tempo è breve.

Esteban González Pons,PPE," – Señora presidenta, si no fuera por la compra masiva de vacunas por parte de la Comisión, muchos países europeos —el mío, por ejemplo—, por falta de peso político o presupuesto, no empezarían a recibir vacunas hasta que Alemania o Francia hubieran acabado sus procesos de vacunación. Quizá después del verano. La decisión europea de centralizar la compra de vacunas nos ha ahorrado una vergonzosa competencia al alza por el precio y el drama de no tener en muchos países con qué proteger a millones de europeos. Cuando se trataba de criticar a los frugales por mostrarse reticentes con el fondo de recuperación, bien que se escucharon voces subrayando esa falta de solidaridad. Sin embargo, ahora que, si se rompiese el consorcio comprador, los del norte no iban a tener problemas de suministro, pero los del sur sí, no se escucha igual de bien nuestro agradecimiento a la Comisión Von der Leyen. Solo se escucha el egoísmo en el norte y en el sur. Otro efecto de la COVID-19, por lo visto, es el nacionalismo. Ahora que Hungría compra vacunas a Rusia por su cuenta, que Alemania proyecta adquirir 600 millones de dosis al margen de la Comisión, que Rusia busca dividirnos ofreciendo su Sputnik a unos sí y a otros no, que el Reino Unido ha convertido el proceso de vacunación en el primer pulso político pos-Brexit, que Serbia vacuna más rápido que la Unión Europea gracias a los chinos, es el peor momento para mostrar desunión. La solidaridad europea está funcionando y en un continente sin fronteras solo la solidaridad puede salvar vidas y economías. Si no nos vacunamos todos es como si no se hubiera vacunado nadie.","– Señora presidenta, si no fuera por la compra masiva de vacunas por parte de la Comisión, muchos países europeos —el mío, por ejemplo—, por falta de peso político o presupuesto, no empezarían a recibir vacunas hasta que Alemania o Francia hubieran acabado sus procesos de vacunación.

Abir Al-Sahlani,ALDE," – Herr talman! Redan innan pandemin var våldet mot kvinnor på tok för utbrett här i EU.

Den här pandemin har inneburit att våldet i hemmet har fått florera fritt, och vissa konservativa krafter har utnyttjat pandemin för att ytterligare inskränka kvinnors mänskliga rättigheter.  Istanbulkonventionens mål är ju att skydda kvinnor från våld, men den utmålas som genuspropaganda och ett hot mot kärnfamiljen. Den polska regeringen, ledd av partiet Lag och rättvisa, är, som första europeiska land, på väg att lämna konventionen. I stället för att arbeta mot alla former av våld mot kvinnor har samma regering föreslagit att införa ett nationellt register över gravida kvinnor och på så sätt institutionalisera kränkningar av kvinnors mänskliga rättigheter – samma regering vars strikta abortlagar har lett till att en kvinna har dött.  Kära kommissionsledamot, detta är inte ett jämställdhetsproblem för EU i vårt samhälle –det här är en skam för oss.
